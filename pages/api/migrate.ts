Its charm is not limited to beautiful scenery and colorful history, but also includes a lack of Rock Pigeons, two fine birding cemeteries, a nice pond with associated riparian area, and a legacy of hybrid grosbeaks, descendants of a Rose-breasted male that took up residence here in 2001. <br /><br /> The two cemeteries are about a half-mile north of town along C149; the smaller of the two, the Lake City Cemetery, abuts the road on the east; the cemetery of the International Order of Odd Fellows is about a quarter-mile off the road to the west. Between them the two cemeteries comprise the only accessible ponderosa stands in the northern two-thirds of the county. They can be good for Clark's Nutcracker, Red Crossbill, and three species of nuthatch, as well as assorted migrants in season. <br /><br /> Pete's Pond occupies the northwest part of Lake City. It has some decent waterbird potential, and the tall deciduous trees along the west edge have hosted the aforementioned hybrid grosbeaks, among other riparian birds. The adult male Rose-breasted frequented feeders in the neighborhood, so these are worth a check. Lake City can host three species of hummingbird in late summer, and we've also had a number of other good birds right in town, including Cassin's Finch, Evening Grosbeak, Red-naped Sapsucker and Common Grackle (not so common at this elevation). There are a number of ponds along Highway 149 both north and south of Lake City, but they never seem to have many birds. <br /><br /> Lake San Cristobal, the second-largest natural lake in Colorado, is too high and too deep to be terribly attractive to waterbirds, but Western Grebe and Gray Catbird have been found there.

Just northeast of Denver and northwest of DIA, Barr Lake is the focus of the eponymous state park and home to the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory. Bird records for the park go back well over a century, making this historically the best-studied birding site in Colorado. In that time, Barr has added at least eighteen species to the state list. The lake is almost completely surrounded by mature cottonwoods, often several deep with considerable undergrowth, making this an excellent place to find migrant landbirds and riparian breeders. There is some wet meadow and cattail marsh habitat, especially along the south and west edges of the lake, as well as below the dam. The southern half of the lake is a wildlife preserve closed to fishing and boating. When water levels are low, as they often are in fall, shorebirding can be tremendous.  &lt;p&gt;A walking and bike trail circles the entire lake, but most birders concentrate on the area around the Nature Center and the RMBO banding station, along the lake&#39;s east side. From the Nature Center, walk west towards the lake over the canal bridge. To get to the banding station, turn right (north). The banding station is about a quarter mile north, where the trail bends hard right near an observation deck. One of the best areas is the low willows in the meadow on the left just before the bend (often festooned with mist nets during migration), but any section of the trees can be good. Note that the banding station hosts many field trips by schoolchildren each spring and fall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To get to the mudflats by the most popular route, head across the bridge from the Nature Center and turn left (south), then branch right onto the Niedrach trail.

To reach this place, take the first dirt road south from Bromley Lane (152nd) east of the railroad tracks, about a quarter mile east of the Bromley Lane exit off I-76 (exit #23).

    About:
      "<p>Together with the adjacent Hale Area (q.v.), this former large reservoir and adjacent riparian woodland reign supreme among the central plains migrant traps. Even with the not insignificant attention it gets, South Republican SWA(fee area) is among the most underbirded locations in Colorado, since most Colorado birders concentrate on either the northeast or southeast parts of the state in spring and fall. An enormous and amazing list of rarities has been seen at Bonny Reservoir, including things like Yellow-crowned Night-Heron, Groove-billed Ani, and practically every rare eastern passerine that has occurred in Colorado. Between the former&amp;nbsp;reservoir, woodland, and some (relatively) high-quality prairie, almost anything could show up here. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The woods around the reservoir can be good for migrants, though sometimes Bonny suffers from having too much habitat. Generally, the more limited trees on the northern side of the lake concentrate the birds somewhat better, but the south can be good too. The best area on the north side is the large hedgerows and cottonwood groves by the Foster&#39;s Grove Campground, and the best area on the south side is along the aforementioned road that accesses the southwestern part of the reservoir. In addition to migrants, the woods around Bonny can also be good for a number of uncommon breeding species, such as Eastern Screech-Owl (common, but nocturnal), Baltimore Oriole (often fairly easy), Bell&#39;s Vireo (ditto), Field Sparrow (a little harder), Red-bellied Woodpecker, Northern Cardinal (sometimes hard to find here), and Eastern Bluebird (can vary from quite common to uncommon). In winter, various isolated hedgerows, especially those along CR 3 about a mile from US 385 and one near the Wagon Wheel Campground, can hold sparrows including Harris&#39;, White-throated, and others, and an occasional Long-eared and maybe even Short-eared or Saw-whet Owl. It may be worth checking these areas out for migrants as well. The trees along the river below the dam are also worth birding. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  In summer Cassin&#39;s Sparrows breed in areas around the reservoir with lots of Yucca. During the winter it is often easy to find Lapland Longspurs in flocks of Horned Larks that abound on the nearby prairie. The dam manager&#39;s residence just north of the dam has a large collection of hedgerows that sports the occasional (albeit hard to find) wintering Saw-whet Owl. There is also a productive hedgerow just below the DOW bunkhouse that can at times also hold this tiny owl. Be sure to also bird the large cattail marshes just below the dam, where you may find Marsh Wren, Virginia Rail, and Sora, sometimes even in the winter. Once, a Woodcock was heard here. Other large cattail marshes can be found around the western and southwestern edges of the reservoir.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lake/Pond/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Marsh, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Grassland/Prairie, Yucca</p><p><b>Directions:</b> South Republican SWA&amp;nbsp;is just east of US 385 about 22 miles north of Burlington. Two entrance roads head east from US 385, one just south of the Republican River and the other just north. The northern access road (CR 3) heads east from US 385 to Foster Grove Campground, then winds a long distance around the north side of the reservoir to the dam road just north of the dam. The southern road (CR 2) heads straight east for a little over a mile before turning south to cross Landsman Creek. Where CR 2 bends south, an old access road, now blocked off, heads east to one of the best marshes at the SWA--you can&#39;t drive to it but it&#39;s an easy walk. Following CR 2 south across the creek and back to the east, you will see the unmarked dirt access road to the southwest part of the reservoir heading off to the left. Past this is the Wagon Wheel Campground and subsequently the south end of the dam. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>The third county IBA, because Prairie Falcons, Cordilleran Flycatchers, Virginia&#39;s Warblers, and Western Tanagers breed in the park. The park has two points of access: Park Headquarters and Visitor Center (east side) and Castlewood Canyon Road (west side).  &lt;p&gt;East side: Visit park headquarters, which has a small exhibit area, a gift shop, and restrooms. From this section it offers Canyon Rim trail and two (connected) trails down into the canyons of Cherry Creek and Lake Gulch. These give access to its main habitats: ponderosa pine woodlands, scrub oak brushlands, mixed Douglas-fir/Ponderosa forest, and rocky cliffs. Here you can encounter Canyon Wrens year-round and, in summer, Violet-green and Cliff swallows.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;West side: Spectacular flights of vultures originate on the west side from April to September. They roost in the trees on the west side of the access road and fly out over the whole park and surrounding area. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the first parking lot walk down the Homestead Trail to Cherry Creek. In summer, over the Cherry Creek bridge and up the east side, birders sometimes find an Indigo Bunting singing among the Lazulis, and maybe a Black-and-white Warbler. For two summers (15 years ago) a territorial Blue-winged Warbler sang from the bridge area. In recent years, Ovenbirds and Red-eyed Vireos have added to the morning chorus. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To sample all park habitats, continue on that trail to walk a circle route from the east rim to Cherry Creek, Castlewood Dam, and back along Cherry Creek to the Homestead (about 6 miles). &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or drive to the next parking lot (restrooms) or the last one (Falls Parking Lot) and explore trails either right or left. East-side trails take you through scrub oak (Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Virginia&#39;s Warbler, Spotted Towhee), and west-side trails lead through ponderosa and mixed conifers up to the cliffs, where you can see, close-up, roosting vultures, nesting Violet-green Swallows and White-throated Swifts. Here you can also see breeding Broad-tailed Hummingbirds and Cordilleran Flycatchers. Common Poorwills call at dusk and dawn. Tread carefully along these trails, which have drop-offs. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the west side road, continue through the park to the open ranchland to the south. Here both species of bluebird and Tree Swallows nest in a l00-box bluebird trail. Lewis&#39;s Woodpeckers (not seen for several years) occasionally show up in the stream bottom east of the road. Beyond the entrance to the Winkler Ranch, look in the hayfields to the east and southeast for Bobolink (usually across the stream), Brewer&#39;s and Red-winged blackbirds, and rarely, Grasshopper Sparrow (both sides of the road) and Dickcissel. New owners have changed the hay-mowing regime, and the Bobolinks have not fared well. To see them, go in June.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Cliff Face, Ponderosa Forest, Mixed Conifer Forest, Scrub Oak Forest, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To east side: from Franktown go south on CO 83 about 3 miles to main park entrance; right (west) into park.

Many of the sites covered separately on this page are actually part of the Comanche (such as Picture Canyon and the Campo Lek). <br /><br />Driving the roads through the grasslands, especially during the winter and early spring, will produce an excellent variety of hawks, including Ferruginous (possibly more numerous here than anywhere else in Colorado), Red-tailed, Rough-legged (November to March), and Swainson's (April to October) Hawks, Prairie Falcon, Merlin, and American Kestrel. During March and April, McCown's and Chestnut-collared Longspurs are possible, and sometimes they even winter in the area. Mountain Plover can be found in areas with very short grass, as well as Burrowing Owls. <br /><br />The Comanche is also the site of most of the recent records for Baird's Sparrow in Colorado, usually in April or early May.

      "<p>The best places from which to scan the actual reservoir are the dam, the north side of the lake near the visitor center, or from the south side, reached by a confusing maze of roads. The north side is off limits during the fall through early spring, and the south side is off limits during the spring and summer (to protect the Piping Plovers and Least Terns that nest here), so plan your attack strategy accordingly. When driving along the southern edge, be careful of the many sand traps that exist along the roads. When and if you do actually reach the reservoir, you can expect some truly awesome congregations of ducks and geese here during the fall and winter, as well as amazing flocks of gulls. Over the years, practically every expected species and a few unexpected ones have been found here.<p>The South Side of John Martin also has some good migrant traps, but most are inaccessible during the spring migration and earlier parts of fall migration. Finding them is no piece of cake, either. Your time is better spent at the north side migrant traps.<p>The area around and below the dam, on the east side of John Martin, is now technically part of John Martin State Park, but is typically referred to as the Lake Hasty Area. The first thing you'll see when coming down the road from the town of Hasty towards the dam are the small ponds, one on either side of the road, near the road to the dam. They can be chock full of ducks (sometimes more so than the entirety of Lake Hasty). Scaled Quail are often seen in the grassland areas just above the campground. The rocky areas here have also produced Greater Roadrunner (though not often) and Rock Wren.<p><a class href=\"http://parks.state.co.us/NR/rdonlyres/248C36F5-3762-436E-AB12-78BCE000042D/0/LakeHastyCampground.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Lake Hasty Campground</a> is made up of lots of trees of various sizes but zero undergrowth. For some reason, despite the lack of undergrowth, this is a good spot to look for unusual eastern migrants, and many a great surprise has been found (e.g., Black-billed Cuckoo, Hermit Warbler, Painted Redstart), so keep an eye out. This campground is especially well known for the resident Red-bellied Woodpeckers and Eastern Bluebirds, which can usually be found on a thorough search.<p>Lake Hasty itself is usually not the most productive of lakes, but sometimes has some diving ducks on it and cormorants on it. Surf Scoter and both swans have shown up, and you might look for Least Tern here in late summer. The river just south of the lake is lined with willows and other vegetation and may be worth a look, especially in the winter when some of the only open water around is found here. The Corps of Engineers Headquarters, just across the river from Lake Hasty, has some trees and a thin hedgerow that may contain some interesting species, and possibly owls in the winter.<p>The town of Hasty just north of the campground and lake complex has a small cemetery with some conifers that may also contain owls in the winter, and maybe a migrant or two in season.

Great Egret and Cattle Egret are uncommon, whereas American Bittern and Black-crowned Night-Heron are more common than sightings suggest. Among raptors, Golden and Bald Eagle are fairly common, and all of Colorado's common falcons appear occasionally; Short-eared Owl is a resident that is only infrequently seen in the NE portion of the refuge; Long-eared Owl has been reported in the past, but Great Horned Owl is by far the most common owl around the refuge and elsewhere in the area.

      "<p>This finest remnant of Colorado&#39;s native prairies is one of the most accessible and productive areas in which to see the remnant populations of Colorado&#39;s native prairie birds. Mountain Plover, Burrowing Owl and McCown&#39;s and Chestnut-collared Longspurs can be found on the Pawnee from early April to October (or to August, in the case of the plovers). McCown&#39;s Longspur is locally common to abundant and easy to locate when performing display flights. Chestnut-collared Longspur is here in much smaller numbers and can be quite local--look especially in areas with slightly longer grass. Burrowing Owls inhabit most good-sized prairie-dog towns, but are not always visible above ground, especially during the middle of the day or when it is very windy. Mountain Plovers are both local and uncommon in short grass and prairie dog towns, though a concerted search should turn them up. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  One of the prime areas on the Pawnee is Murphy&#39;s Pasture, along CR 96 west of CR 77, just northwest of Briggsdale. All the specialties listed above can be seen here. The Chestnut-collared Longspurs are most likely starting 3.0 miles west of CR 77. Another good spot for the plover and both longspurs is a few miles west, along CR 65 in its first mile north of CO 14. Also check for the owl around the intersection of CO 14 x CR 57, and for the owl and the plover at CO 14 x CR 51. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Another prime area is farther west, north of the town of Nunn, around the Central Plains Experimental Range. The pasture on the southeast corner of US 85 and CR 114 is an excellent spot for Chestnut-collared Longspur. McCown&#39;s is regular along CR 45 south of CR 122, and a seasonal wet spot on the west side of the road there can be good for waterbirds. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Although the spots mentioned above are among the best known and the most frequently visited, it should be stressed that almost any road can be productive in the enormous area bounded by US 85 to the west, CO 14 to the south, CR 77 to the east, and the Wyoming border to the north. Explore and enjoy it well, keeping in mind that the PNG is a patchwork of private and public lands--when in doubt, stay on the road. Also keep in mind that many of the dirt roads in the Pawnee can become impassable after heavy rains, that mud traps can persist long after the rain has passed, and that the resulting dry mud can hang up passenger vehicles. Be prepared to backtrack and detour if necessary. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Besides the above specialties, other birds that can be found on the Pawnee during the breeding season include Long-billed Curlew (rare), Upland Sandpiper (rare), Swainson&#39;s and Ferruginous Hawks, Prairie Falcon, Golden Eagle, Say&#39;s Phoebe, Loggerhead Shrike, Rock Wren (usually around eroded washes, occasionally human habitation), Sage Thrasher, Lark Bunting, Grasshopper Sparrow, Cassin&#39;s Sparrow (usually near yucca--populations fluctuate yearly), Lark Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, Brewer&#39;s Sparrow, and Western Meadowlark. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  In winter look for raptors (Rough-legged Hawk, Merlin, and all summering species except Swainson&#39;s Hawk), Northern Shrike, Horned Lark, Lapland Longspur, and (if you are very lucky) Snow Bunting or Snowy Owl.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Grassland/Prairie, Yucca, Pond/Lake/Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> A map is essential for exploring this area, and chances are you will get lost without one. A good rule to remember is that in Weld County roads with even numbers run east west, and roads with odd numbers run north south, so if you subtract the numbers of two roads that run the same direction, and divide by two, you have the distance between the roads. To get to Murphy&#39;s Pasture, turn north off of SR 14 onto CR 69 (18.5 miles east of Ault, 4 miles west of Briggsdale) and drive for 3 miles to CR 96. Turn right (east) onto CR 96. Murphy&#39;s Pasture is considered to be from here to CR 77, 4 miles to the east. To get to the Central Plains Experimental Range, drive north from Nunn on US-85 for 7.5 miles to CR 114. CR 45 is 8 miles west of this intersection, and CR 122 is 4 miles north of the CR 45 and CR 114 intersection.</p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>This area includes Pueblo Reservoir, Swallows State Wildlife Area, Rock Canyon and Valco Ponds State Wildlife Area. <br /><br />According to Birding Magazine Pueblo Reservoir is among the top ten inland gull sites in the U.S. Winter is the prime time for gulls and a place to look is on the tires at the South Shore Marina. On the north side look near the Sailboard Launching area, the areas near the North Shore Marina, West Fisherman's Point and anywhere near an ice line. Many species of loon, grebe and duck are abundant from late fall to early spring. The water rarely freezes over and the Pueblo Reservoir Christmas Bird Count holds the top three species totals for all CBC's in Colorado(129,123 &116). Land birds to look for are cholla and pinyon & juniper inhabitants such as Canyon Towhee, Scaled Quail, Sage Thrasher, Juniper Titmouse, Bushtit and Loggerhead Shrike. The Pueblo Reservoir, according to Christmas Bird Count data often claims the world's largest wintering population of Mountain Bluebirds. Western Bluebirds mix with the Mountain Bluebirds and Eastern Bluebirds show up regularly. <br /><br />Swallows State Wildlife Area, named for the large number of nesting Cliff Swallows, can be reached by turning south on Swallows Road off Hwy 50 just west of Pueblo West. This is the extreme west end of Pueblo Reservoir and is good for pinyon/juniper birds. There is a large heronry with Great Blue Herons and Double-crested Cormorants. Osprey nest in various spots on the west end of the reservoir and if you are boating the reservoir look for raptors, Barn Owls and Great Horned Owls on the cliffs. There are many marked, public trails on both sides of the reservoir that take you through canyons, juniper, cholla, and cottonwood riparian habitat. Rock Wrens are common in summer. Pinyon Jays are not common. Your best chance of seeing or hearing them would be in the western areas of the reservoir. Resident roadrunners or Ladder-backed Woodpecker could turn up, but consider yourself lucky to see them. <br /><br />All of the western end of Pueblo Reservoir is State Wildlife Area, the eastern end is State Park land. There is a road on the southwest state wildlife land that goes through canyons as far as the Swallows SWA and beyond. Access this road about 10 miles west of Pueblo off Hwy 96. <br /><br />Rock Canyon is the area below the dam in the State Park. This is mostly but not entirely on the north side of the river. Rock Canyon has parking lots, bathrooms paved trails, ponds and cottonwood riparian habitat. There is a footbridge over the river here and you can walk south and east to Valco Ponds State Wildlife Area. You can also park at Valco Ponds off Hwy 96 and access the State Park on foot. Both areas have outstanding riparian habitat along the Arkansas River. Numerous ponds host waterfowl and gulls. Valco Ponds is known as a late fall migrant trap and many an odd warbler has appeared there. There are many foot trails on both sides of the river. A gravel mining operation has recently been completed in the area and more walking territory may soon open to the public. An extensive program to remove invasive trees and replace them with native shrubs and trees has begun from Rock Canyon and Valco Ponds SWA through Pueblo and should be completed by 2010. This will take place during the winter months.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Lowland Riparian, Stream, Rimrock/Mesa</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From I-25 go four miles west on U.S. 50 to Pueblo Blvd. Go south four miles to Thatcher (Hwy 96) west to Valco Ponds (3 miles) and up the hill to access the State Park. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

White-tailed Ptarmigan can usually be found in summer in tundra along Trail Ridge Road near Medicine Bow Curve. In summer, Brown-capped Rosy-Finches sometimes frequent the Alpine Visitor Center (look for these elusive birds near the edges of permanent glaciers). In sub-alpine forest, watch for Dusky Grouse. Endovalley is an excellent location for spruce-fir species. Red-naped and Williamson&amp;#39;s Sapsuckers prefer lower elevations in Ponderosa Pine forest with good stands of older Quaking Aspen, which provide nest sites. These nest holes may also serve Northern Pygmy-Owl, Northern Saw-Whet and Flammulated Owls (Rashid, 2005). Three-toed Woodpeckers may be found anywhere with dead trees. Picnic areas throughout the park attract corvids including Gray Jays and Clark&amp;#39;s Nutcrackers.

      "<p>(Contributed by Bill Schmoker) To enjoy the peak birding season for this high-elevation area, plan on a hike in July or early August. The walk up to St. Mary's Glacier takes you through spruce/fir forest, with chances for birds typical of this habitat, including American Three-toed Woodpecker. When you emerge at St. Mary's Lake you will notice nice willow habitat along the north side. Watch and listen here for Lincoln's & Fox Sparrows and Wilson's Warblers. Use caution climbing the steep face of the glacier. Stick to the northeast (right) side as you climb. Once the glacier levels out a bit you can cross it safely and climb up to the Krummholz habitat of dwarf spruce and bristlecone pines above the glacier. Brewer's Sparrows are a special high-elevation treat if you can find them here, and White-crowned Sparrows will be abundant. Continue northwest towards James Peak, crossing a wide alpine tundra flat with patches of Krummholz and willows. Rocky outcrops may house Rock Wrens in addition to pikas and marmots. When you begin ascending the flanks of James Peak, go slowly and listen closely--this is a good spot to see or hear White-tailed Ptarmigan. The cliffy areas above Loch Lomond and the snowfields on the flanks of James Peak are likely spots for Brown-capped Rosy-Finches but be careful--you wouldn't want to misstep here.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Spruce-Fir Forest, Streamside Willow, Krummholz, Alpine Tundra</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Leave I-70 at exit 238 just west of Idaho Springs and head north on Fall River Road (275 Rd).

    About:
      "<p>One of the smallest and most urban refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System, Two Ponds has great potential as a birding spot. The refuge is split up into two parts, the Environmental Education Area and the Prairie Management Area. The Prairie Management Area, which covers the western two-thirds of the property, is open to the public seven days a week, but the Environmental Education Area, which contains the refuge's namesake ponds, is only open Tuesdays and Thursdays 8 AM to 4 PM, Saturdays 11 AM to 7 PM, and at other times by reservation for groups of ten or more. <br /><br />The Environmental Education Area, in the northeast corner of the refuge, actually contains three ponds. The two closest to the parking lot are hemmed in by riparian tangles dense enough to satisfy even the shyest skulker. These spots should be a high priority on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays during migration. The ponds themselves are probably too small and shaded to attract many migrating waterbirds, but they greatly increase the attraction of the park to local breeders. There is some decent cattail marsh around some of the ponds. Parking for the Environmental Education Area is on the south side of West 80th east of Kipling. <br /><br />The Prairie Management Area is criss-crossed by no fewer than three irrigation canals: the Church Ditch, the Farmer's Highline Canal and the Croke Canal. All have mature trees along at least part of their length, and there is some really impressive riparian stuff along the Church Ditch and the southern part of the Farmer's Highline Canal--dense groves that are at least a couple trees thick for a decent distance. Walking trails line all these canals, so birding them is easy. Parking for the Prairie Management Area is at the south end of the medical center parking lot on the southeast corner of West 80th and Kipling. You can also park on the south side of the NWR along 77th Street east of Kipling, which may be the best choice if you are hitting the southern groves.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Pond, Marsh, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From US 36 between Denver and Boulder, take the Sheridan Boulevard exit. Follow Sheridan south about one mile to W. 80th Avenue and turn right (west). In a little over a mile and a half you will see a sign for a left turn into Two Ponds NWR. This is the parking lot for the Environmental Education Area. To get to the Prairie Management Area, continue west to Kipling and park in the lot of the medical center on the SE corner of 80th and Kipling. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

In winter, both Harris's & White-throated Sparrows are regularly found in La Veta, particularly at feeders. There are several public areas for birding. First, a Public Nature Area on the southeast corner of Garland & Birch is located east of CSH 12 which bisects the town.

Go east on Cuchara up the hill. The road bends south to the lakes about about 1+ miles from town. These lakes can be good for waterfowl and Bald Eagles in fall & winter. Bobolinks were once seen here in spring. Finally, the Wahatoya State Wildlife Area east of town is reached on Moore Ave. just south of the railroad tracks which cross CSH 12. From the highway, go east on Moore about 6-7 blocks and watch for its junction with Spruce Street, which bends left.

Sometimes mountain birds like Lewis&amp;#39;s Woodpecker or Mountain Chickadee wander down to spend some time here. The campground road is closed during the winter, but you can park at the gate and walk in. In late spring and summer, this popular campground can get pretty hectic. Also be aware that Crow Valley can (rarely) have spectacular and dangerous floods when heavy rain swells the creek. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  About a mile north of the campground entrance, on the west side of CR 77, is the Pawnee National Grassland Work Station. The small trees around this office can attract migrant passerines, especially sparrows, and they have attracted occasional rarities in winter, including owls, Bohemian Waxwing and Common Redpoll. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The town of Briggsdale itself has very few large trees and is probably safe to skip during migration, but nearby Bidwell Lake is worth checking for shorebirds when it has water.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Take CO 14 to Briggsdale (60 miles west of Sterling and I-76, and 38 miles east of Fort Collins and I-25), and turn north onto CR 77.

      "<p>(submitted by Andrew Spencer) When most people think of this remote (notice a theme with this part of the state?) National Monument, they think of the part in Utah with the amazing dinosaur fossils, and not the equally (or far more, in this author&#39;s mind) amazing Gates of Lodore, or Harper&#39;s Point and Echo Park.  &lt;p&gt;On the north end of the park, adjacent to Browns Park NWR, are the stunning Gates of Lodore. The road into here follows the Green River for a ways, allowing good vantage points to scan for ducks, and access to some extensive cottonwood groves that may be good for migrants and have breeding species such as Eastern Kingbird, Blue Grosbeak, Yellow-breasted Chat, and others. The Gates of Lodore have nesting Canyon Wren, White-throated Swift, and lots of PJ woodland with all the benefits thereof. A trail leaves from the end of the road and goes to the mouth of the famous Canyon of Lodore.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the south end of the park, adjacent to the Utah border, the Harper&#39;s Point road heads north from the town of Dinosaur, travels through Colorado, crosses over into Utah, and then back into Colorado to end at Harper&#39;s point. The views possible from this road are truly incomparable, and remind one of the Grand Canyon. Greater Sage-Grouse can be downright common along the southern portions of this road, and Sage Thrasher and Sage Sparrow are both possible. At Harper&#39;s Corner there is a nature trail through excellent PJ, where one can find Juniper Titmouse, Pinyon Jay, and all the other PJ regulars.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the Utah side of the road a dirt road heads east into Colorado and down to the bottom of the canyon in Echo Park and Steamboat Rock. This road passes through lots more PJ and sagebrush, and into small but excellent riparian groves along Pool Creek on the way down to the river. Where the road hits the Green River are more riparian groves, and cliffs with White-throated Swifts, Canyon and Rock Wrens, and possibly Black Phoebes. Even if you don&#39;t see many birds here, this road is worth driving for the scenery, pictographs, and neat Whistling Cave.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Lowland Riparian, Rimrock/Mesa</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To get to the northern part of the National Monument, travel NW on SR-318 for 40 miles from Maybell and turn south onto CR 10. Follow CR 10 for half a mile to the intersection with CR 34 and take a right (north). Take CR 34 for a 9 miles to the Gates of Lodore. To get to the southern part of the National Monument, from the just east of the town of Dinosaur along US-40 near the Utah border, head north on Harper&#39;s Corner Road. The road is in Colorado for 21.5 miles from US-40, the crosses into Utah for 4 miles to where the Echo Park Road takes off to the east, and then an additional 4 miles to the Colorado border. From here the road goes an additional 3 miles to the parking lot for Harper&#39;s Corner. The Echo Park Road is in Utah for 3 miles and then crosses back into Colorado.

McIntosh is a fairly large lake that the City of Longmont now operates as a public park, which has limited power boating and water skiing, while improving access. Oddly, there are some drawbacks to both of these points; markers in the water intended for boaters provided good perches for terns, and a proposed trail system around the lake may end up proving a disturbance to many species if it is too close to the shore, especially in the Northwest corner.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> In Longmont, take 17th Avenue west from US 287 for 2.5 miles and turn right (north) on Lakeshore Drive.

      "<p>This is a large park on the west side of the city that includes a zoo, a small amusement park, a Frisbee golf course, baseball diamonds and tennis courts. Of interest to birders are the many large trees in the park plus the two small ponds. In winter, the pond near the Administration Building is usually teeming with ducks and geese, both wild and domestic. These birds are fed regularly by visitors to the pond and even the wild ones become quite tame. Unusual ducks and gulls are regularly found here. A Eurasian Wigeon spent several months in the park during the winters of 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. There is a small breeding population of feral Mandarin Ducks that have been year-round residents in the Pueblo area for many years. They can sometimes be seen at this pond or along the Arkansas River nearby. During the fall and spring, warblers, vireos and other migrants can be found in the trees throughout the park. An especially productive area is along a small creek in the western part of the Frisbee golf course. Pueblo City Park provides access to the Goodnight River Trail and the Olive Marsh Nature Preserve. To access these, walk down the paved path just west of the baseball fields to a small diversion dam on the Arkansas River. <br /><br />The Goodnight River Trail starts at this dam and goes west for 1.5 miles along an abandoned railroad track on the south side of the river. It dead-ends at a locked gate at the now closed Transit Mix Concrete facility. The trail passes three water-filled gravel pits that can be good for ducks and gulls in the winter. The area around the pits is presently closed to public access so they must be viewed from the trail. There are several small marshes near the trail which may produce Marsh Wrens and Swamp Sparrows. Look for Lincoln's and Harris's Sparrows in the brushy areas alongside the trail. <br /><br />To get to the Olive Marsh Nature Preserve, walk downstream from the dam and cross the footbridge to the paved trail on the north side of the river. Turn right and follow the trail east for 0.25 mile to the Olive Marsh on the north. Look for a path that passes through an opening in the fence that is sized to admit pedestrians only. The area around the marsh is densely vegetated with Russian Olives and larger trees. The marshy area holds herons and ducks. In the spring and fall, migrant songbirds can be found in the brush and trees. The Olive Marsh is one of Pueblo's most noted birding areas and many rare and unusual species have been seen here. <br /><br />Returning to the park's west entrance, drive west on Goodnight Avenue through a residential area that has become a hotspot for White-winged Doves and Eurasian Collared-Doves. On the 2004 Christmas count, 60+ White-winged Doves were found in this area.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Park, Pond, Stream, Lowland Riparian</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From the intersection at US 50, drive 3.5 mi. south on Pueblo Blvd. (CO 45) to Goodnight Ave. Turn left into the park. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

The best views are from the road along CR 47 looking west. Thus, best viewing is in the morning. Sometimes, on windless days with few heatwaves, nearly the entire reservoir can be observed with a good telescope. Lower Latham is, however, better known for the small marshy ponds along CR 48 just south of the reservoir. These are some of the finest roadside marshes in the state, a reliable location for Virginia Rail, Sora, Marsh Wren, and blackbirds including Great-tailed Grackle. Occasionally, American Bitterns are found here, and in many winters, Short-eared Owls can be found at dusk. In migration the wet fields and canals along this road can fill up with herons, egrets and ibis, making this one of the better places to look for rarities like Glossy Ibis; Little Blue and Tricolored Herons have also been found here.

      "<p>North of Ridgway, this reservoir is the only significant body of water in Ouray County. As such, it is a magnet for migrating waterbirds and almost anything could be found here, given enough visits, particularly as the reservoir ages and develops a more diverse ecology. Examples of species that have been found on the reservoir that are rare in western Colorado include Pacific Loon and Glossy Ibis. The terrestrial habitats in Ridgway State Park are dominated by Pinyon-Juniper, thus species typical of those habitats (Pinyon Jay, Juniper Titmouse, and Black-throated Gray Warbler) abound. In the riparian gallery forest on the south side of the park, typical breeding species include Western Wood-Pewee, Warbling Vireo, White-breasted Nuthatch, and Western Tanager. However, migration in this area, particularly in fall, can bring any number of interesting species. Among those that have occurred here are Cassin's Vireo, Northern Waterthrush, and Magnolia and Hooded warblers. Note: A State Parks pass (daily or annual) is required for entrance.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Lowland Riparian</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Ridgway, travel north on US 550 to the Dallas Meadows entrance to Ridgway State Park. To look at the lake, turn north past the entrance kiosk and then quickly left. One can drive out onto the shore here, with the usual caveats about care when driving on lake shores that might be wet. If the shore is too wet or one cares not to drive there, one can continue north on the Park road to its terminus to get reasonable views of the lake and shore. To visit the nice gallery forest at the south end, turn south past the entrance kiosk and travel to the end of the road and park; then take the trail that departs from near the bathrooms west toward the Uncompahgre River. To continue the tour of the reservoir and Park, return to US 550 and travel north to the main entrance to the Park. However, on your way (particularly, if one is not planning on entering the Park), don't forget to scan the water from US 550 (there are wide shoulders onto which one can pull off to effect this). There are two locations to scan, the first being the arm of the reservoir that our directions just left and the second is the marina. From the main part of the park, one can bird the lake at the marina and at the dam end of the water. There is also fine landbirding in the extensive Pinyon-Juniper, with the campground hosting a particularly diverse mix of breeding species, including Black-throated Gray Warbler. If arriving from the north, one will simply follow these directions in reverse. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>A deservedly famous metro-area migrant trap. Among other lesser claims to fame, this is the site of the first state record of Red-faced Warbler. Some local birders say that Wheat Ridge has not been as productive in recent years as it was previously, but this may be due to reduced coverage, as the habitat is still some of the very best in urban Denver. The greenbelt protects a nice wide swath of mature riparian cottonwood forest along Clear Creek that stretches more than a mile between Youngfield and Kipling streets, encompassing four good-sized ponds and quite a bit of brushy marsh and swampy second growth. <br /><br />The west parking lot accesses the broadest section of the Greenbelt and is closest to the ponds. West Lake, a deep gravel pit visible from the parking lot, is the largest and most productive for waterfowl. Directly east of it is Bass Lake, a smaller and marshier place worth checking for puddle ducks, herons and rails. South of these two ponds, a series of swampy trails explores all manner of dense brush and wet draws, where you could find yourself swimming in sparrows and snipe--or, if you're not careful, stagnant water. Just to the north across the river is Tabor Lake, accessible by footbridge, whose tiny island is home to a small but tightly packed breeding colony of Great Blue Herons and Double-crested Cormorants. <br /><br />The east parking lot is closer to the dense woods where the best migrants are often found, and Eastern Screech-Owl is semi-regular near the parking lot, in the first lone tree on the left that partially overhangs the main trail west. Look in and around the hole about ten feet up. If you don't see a roosting owl there, check nearby trees. <br /><br />In between these parking lots, the greenbelt can be accessed from Prospect Park on the north side of the creek, which has a lake of its own, Prospect Pond, worth checking for waterfowl in season.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Marsh, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To get to the west parking lot: From I-70, take exit 266 and follow signs for West 44th Avenue. Turn west on 44th Avenue and then south on Youngfield Street. The parking lot is on the left (east) side of Youngfield just after the Clear Creek bridge. To get to the east parking lot: From I-70 exit 267, take Kipling south about three quarters of a mile and turn right (west) on 41st Avenue. Follow 41st as it winds around the water treatment plant and look for signs to the greenbelt parking lot. To get to Prospect Park: Follow directions as to the east parking lot, but turn right (west) on 44th Avenue and go one mile west.

      "<p>This reservoir is one mile long, from the Southeast to the Northwest corner. It is by far the best large body of water in the county to bird. Unfortunately most of the birding is from a distance, but it is absolutely worth a stop if you want to look at water in the county. Along with all the regular occurring species of duck you can occasionally find Barrow's Goldeneye, Long-tailed Duck and all three Scoters. It hosts Common Loons annually and usually a Pacific Loon or two will stop by in the fall. Both Yellow-billed and Red-throated Loons have been recorded here also. At least 15 species of gull and 7 species of tern have been reported from here. Some years you can find shorebirds here but for the most part shorebirding at this location is difficult due to distance. The grasslands around the reservoir are host to many of the grassland sparrows. There is a prairie dog town that has hosted Burrowing Owls in some years. Scaled Quail can be found near the parking area where there is a pile of broken up concrete. You have a very good chance of finding Lapland Longspurs in the winter if you decide to walk around the reservoir.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Reservoir, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From I-25 take the Academy exit (exit 135) and head east/north to Bradley Road.

      "<p>This is one of the very few State Wildlife Areas that charge an entrance fee. The SWA is comprised of two basic habitats: the extensive riparian habitat below the dam, and the reservoir with its associated mudflats. <br /><br />The area below the dam consists of an extensive mosaic of Russian Olive thickets, mature cottonwood groves, and assorted swampy habitats. It is a four- or five-mile walk from one end of this area to the other, so budget five or six hours to cover it all thoroughly. The area can be accessed from either of two parking lots, one of which is in Washington County and the other of which is in Logan. The county line situation at Prewitt can be confusing, so county listers should check their maps carefully. Most vagrants are found within the first mile or two of the Washington County parking lot, but that is probably because this area tends to get the most birding coverage. <br /><br />When planning your attack on this big place, keep in mind that the cottonwood forest is usually the least productive. The thickets and swamps, on the other hand, can be full of landbirds; practically every migrant on the Colorado list has shown up here. Fall trips can usually produce at least one good eastern warbler. Spring trips can also be good, but are less consistent. Even if migration is not in swing, Eastern Screech-Owl is common to abundant, but often hard to find—whistling will occasionally elicit a response. During the warmer months Red-headed Woodpecker can also be abundant, and both rails can be found in the cattail marshes. <br /><br />Even if the landbird migration isn't good, there are usually thousands of shorebirds on the extensive mudflats that form around the reservoir most years in late summer. Anything is possible here; in particular, Prewitt is known for being one of the most reliable spots in Colorado for juvenile Short-billed Dowitchers and Buff-breasted Sandpipers in fall. The large concentrations of shorebirds and dabbling ducks attract Peregrine Falcons, and Sabine's Gull can often be found amid thousands of Franklin's Gulls and many Black Terns. Keep an eye out for Caspian Tern and rare gulls and waders.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lake/Pond/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Marsh</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From the Merino exit off I-76 (exit 102), go one mile north to CO 6 and turn right (east).

      "<p>The first stop in town for most birders is the Lamar Community College Woods. Ask any Colorado birder to list the top migrant traps in the state, and this location is guaranteed to be high on the list. Most of these birders will also bemoan the recent habitat destruction which they claim has affected the potential of the spot. Practically every species of eastern warbler that has occurred in the state has been seen here, plus almost every other migrant. The northern portions of the woods are usually the best for warblers, but the whole strip should be checked. The swampy area in the central part of the woods often has a Northern Waterthrush, and possibly flycatchers perching on the dead trees. Solitary Sandpipers can usually be found along the creek in the spring. If the cardinals are around, they are most often found in the brushier undergrowth towards the south end of the strip. In the winter the woods are not as productive, but sometimes large sparrow flocks are present, with Harris' and White-throated possible, and during winters when mountain species invade the plains, this is the best location to look for species such as Mountain Chickadee and Cassin's Finch. The summer is generally not such a good time to bird here, but there is a substantial breeding population of Mississippi Kites and Red-headed Woodpeckers. Eastern Screech-Owl has been seen here, but not recently. <br /><br />Willow Creek Park is very close to the community college woods as the migrant flies, and even though it lacks underbrush, it can occasionally be very good for migrant warblers and vireos, as well as for nesting Mississippi Kites in summer. <br /><br />The nearby Lamar High School Grove is not to be missed. The narrow but dense hedgerow here has produced many a good migrant over the years. The grove is particularly charming because it can be birded easily by one person, and birds reported here are usually a cinch to refind. <br /><br />South of town is the last don't-miss spot in Lamar: Fairmount Cemetery. (Actually Lamar has two cemeteries, but if you hear birders talk about the \"Lamar Cemetery,\" this is the one they mean.) The trees can be good for almost any tree-top migrant, but the extensive pruning of lower branches has denuded the cemetery of undergrowth. Nonetheless the cemetery has a better reputation as a migrant trap than the city park, possibly because of its many mature evergreens. <br /><br />Five miles south of Lamar along US 287/US 385 you will see a radio tower on the east side of the road with a row of small trees lining the access road. There is no access to the trees, but if you pull over in front of the gate, you should be able to spot the resident pair of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers if they are present, as they were from 2002-2004 (but, sadly, not in 2005). <br /><br />Although most birders stick to the south, the north side of town may also be worth checking. The \"other\" cemetery in Lamar, Riverside Cemetery, also has some trees that could attract migrants. This cemetery is in the northeast part of town, on the north side of Maple Street, east of Main Street/US 287/US 385. <br /><br />Along Main Street/US 287/US 385 where it crosses the Arkansas River are a couple of gravel pit ponds on the east side of the road which can be decent for diving ducks and grebes. In this water-challenged county, it may be worth parking south of the bridge and walking up to scope these pits.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Lowland Riparian, Park/Cemetery, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Lamar is along the Arkansas River at the intersection of US 50, US 287 and US 385. To get to Willow Creek Park, drive south on Main Street (US 287/US 385) through downtown. Turn left on Memorial Highway (not really a highway) which heads east one block to the park. To get to the Community College woods, continue south through town on Main Street/287/385 from Memorial another 200 yards to Savage Avenue. Turn left (east) into the community college parking lot. Drive straight back behind the building and park in any open spot. The woods along Willow Creek parallel the campus for its entire length. To get to the high school grove, from the intersection of Main and Savage, go west on Savage. The high school is at the end of the road in about half a mile. Go around to the back of the high school by turning right on 11th Street and then left on Willow Valley Road. Park near the intersection of Willow Valley and 14th. The High School grove runs south along the east side of 14th for about 200 yards. To get to the cemetery, continue south from Willow Creek Park on Memorial about a mile and a half south of town. Alternatively, from 287/385 south of town, turn east on College, then south towards the cemetery a couple blocks away. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>Mention Arapahoe County to almost any birder in Colorado, and this is the site that comes to mind. It has a well-deserved place among the triumvirate of metro area reservoirs (along with Barr Lake and Chatfield). Cherry Creek's main strength seems to be gulls. Just about every species reported in the state has been seen here, many of them more than once. Large flocks of waterbirds often grace the lake, and uncommon and rare species such as Long-tailed Duck, all three scoters, Red-throated Loon and Red-necked Grebe occur with some frequency. Super rarities that Cherry Creek has to its name include Arctic Loon, Iceland, Little, Glaucous-winged, and Great Black-backed Gulls, and Golden-crowned Sparrow.<p>There are two entrances into Cherry Creek. By far the more often used is the west entrance, so this description will go around the lake starting from there. As you drive in from the west entrance you will pass through some good grassland that has Swainson's Hawk during the summer, and Northern Shrike and Harlan's Hawk during the winter. Also keep an eye out for Rough-legged Hawk. Before long the road will come to the marina at the NW corner of the lake. This is often a great spot to scan gull flocks, especially early in the morning when they sometimes roost on the docks. The water around here is often some of the last to freeze (at least near shore), and can be a good place to look for ducks in the late fall. It is also the only good vantage point for this whole quadrant of the lake.<p>From the marina a loop road goes all the way around the lake to the NE corner. Following this road south you will pass through tons of good grassland on the right, and the tree-ringed reservoir on the left. The first two loops you come to on the left go to good vantage points for the west side of the lake, and to some small stands of trees that rarely have much in them. The next loop to the south is the Cottonwood Creek Loop. This loop ends at a trailhead that provides access to a myriad of trails in the SW portion of the park. One trail goes down to a viewing platform on the lake edge, where you can scan much of the south end of the lake, as well as the extensive cattail marshes. This end of the lake often has large flocks of dabblers, and, when the water is low, shorebirds.<p>Also leaving from this trailhead are some trails heading into the woods to the south. The trail first crosses Cottonwood Creek, which can be a great spot to look for migrants, Marsh Wren, and occasionally rails. The woods to the south and east of here rarely get much birding attention, but are of very high quality. Covering them can take some time, but would probably be well worth it. The habitat in here is particularly good for Winter Wrens, and this author has seen them there more than once.<p>Back where the main road around the reservoir crosses Cottonwood Creek there is a decent sized wetland that seems to be somewhat reliable for Green Heron, and would be a spot to look for other waders and shorebirds. The loop road continues south and east from here, through more grassland (with all the same species mentioned above). Ring-necked Pheasant seems especially reliable along this stretch. Short afterwards, the road crosses over Cherry Creek, and the associated thick riparian corridor. This is a good spot to look for landbirds, ducks on the small ponds, and snipe in the wetlands.<p>From here the road bends back north. Shortly after the creek crossing you can turn right towards another trailhead, where yet another myriad of trails heads south along Cherry Creek. By following these trails one can access more prairie, some excellent wetlands with rails, ducks, snipe, and others, and even more excellent riparian. This area of Cherry Creek doesn't receive much coverage, which is a true shame given its potential.<p>Continuing along to the north, the road reaches a split. Go right to reach the east entrance and most of the east end of the park, and go left to head towards the east boat ramp. From here you can drive right up to and along the water, providing excellent views of any gull flocks in the area, and ducks and other waterbirds on the lake. The gull viewing can be especially good here when the south end of the lake is frozen and the gulls are perched on the edge of the ice.<p>Heading back towards the eastern entrance, pass the split from the south end of the park, and continue east and north. Turn left at the next turn to head the NE part of the park, or go straight to exit the park via the eastern entrance. Continuing north into the park, you will pass a couple of small parking spots on the left that access some weedy gullies that can be good for sparrows (Harris' Sparrow has shown up more than once), and then the campground on the right. The riparian areas here can be good for landbirds, including warblers in migration and sparrows during the fall and winter.<p>Just past the campground you can turn left for the swim beach, which provides another good vantage point for the lake, and the best for scanning the NW corner. This is often the best spot to scan for divers, which like the deeper portions of the lake nearer the dam. Gull watching can sometimes be good from here, though it is generally better from the SW corner. Also be sure to check the trees around the swim beach parking area. They may not look like much, but for some reason migrants concentrate here, especially in the locust grove by the bathrooms. A system of trails winds through some of the thicker growth, and to a small pond, where you could find more migrants, dabblers, and the occasional Black-crowned Night-Heron or Green Heron. </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Cherry Creek has two entrances, the main entrance on the eastern side of the lake, and a smaller side entrance on the western side. To get to the eastern entrance, take Parker Road south from I-225 for almost 2 miles to the entrance, on the right. To get to the west entrance, take Yosemite St south from I-225 for half a mile, and turn left onto Union Ave. Take Union Ave east for less than half a mile, take a right onto Dayton St, than an immediate left into the western entrance to the park. Note that Cherry Creek Reservoir has a small extra fee for entrance on top of the normal state parks fee, so even if you have a state parks annual pass, you still need to shell out a couple extra dollars here. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

Terry Lake is more than one mile long, and over one-half mile wide, but it is surrounded by private land and only approachable for a brief stretch on its west side. The lake is fairly deep and does not experience much variation in its water level. Consequently it is best for diving birds and not particularly good for shorebirds. Huge congregations of up to a thousand grebes and mergansers are not uncommon in late spring or early fall. Loons and terns are also likely.

      "<p>This little mountain hamlet has become known as one of the more regular sites in the state for winter flocks of rosy-finches. The Fawn Brook Inn at the south end of town along the CO 7 business loop typically stocks an impressive array of seed feeders that are easily viewed from the road. Flocks of rosies may come in at any time, but are more regular in some winters than others, and are typically most reliable during inclement weather. Other regular feeder visitors include Steller's Jay, Black-capped and Mountain Chickadees, all three species of nuthatch, and all manner of juncos. You may also see Pine and Evening Grosbeaks, Song Sparrow, Pine Siskin, American Goldfinch, and Cassin's Finch. Even Northern Pygmy-Owl and Common Redpoll have been seen here, but they are certainly not to be expected. Birders are welcome to view the feeders, but donations of seed are greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Take a walk around the rest of town when you are done with the Fawn Brook. Many of the above feeder birds have been seen elsewhere in town, especially at a set of feeders on the north side of Ski Road a few blocks west of the CO 7 business loop. The town and the feeders are worth checking in summer, too, being one of the more regular spots in the county for Band-tailed Pigeon (uncommon to rare), and a fantastic spot to find hummingbirds in late summer, with four species regular. If you are here in summer, you may want to follow Ski Road west of town to its end at the Saint Vrain Mountain Trailhead. This out-of-the-way spot is my favorite trailhead in Boulder County. It provides access to a beautiful trail which follows a small stream through aspen groves, lodgepole forest, flowery mountain meadows, and limber pine forest on its way to ptarmigan country. Butterfly diversity is high here, and the birds aren't bad either. Look for Cassin's Finch and Empidonax flycatchers, among other mountain birds.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Mixed Conifer Forest, Aspen Grove, Urban/Suburban, Mountain Meadow, Lodgepole Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Longmont or Boulder, head west on CO 66 or US 36, respectively, to the town of Lyons.

From the business loop, you can follow Ski Road (FR 116) approximately 2.5 miles to the trailhead and small parking lot. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>This remote state wildlife area is only easily accessible through New Mexico (but see below). Lake Dorothey's claim to fame is the first state record of Acorn Woodpecker, which colonized this area for a few years in the mid ‘90s. The habitat is generally ponderosa and scrub-oak, with some higher meadows on the Raton Mesa. The ponderosa canyons should be checked for Hepatic Tanager among other more common mountain birds. <br /><br />If you have four-wheel drive, high clearance, and a bit of a Lewis-and-Clark complex, you can actually reach Lake Dorothey without leaving Colorado. The road over San Francisco Pass (CR 85.5) is a public county road, but you'd never know it by looking at the farmhouse gate marked \"No Trespassing.\" All the land beyond the gate on both sides of the road is indeed private and off-limits, but the road can be driven, barely. The route starts out in PJ and oak habitat and then enters one of the most extensive stands of New Mexico locust in the state before working its way to ponderosa and mixed-conifer forest. It tops out on San Francisco Pass, then heads down to Lake Dorothey, which may or may not be on the other side of a locked gate. The unique vegetation recalls areas far to the south, and the road runs through likely breeding spots for Hepatic Tanager and possibly other outpost colonizers from the south like Acorn Woodpecker and White-winged Dove. Unfortunately, the road surface consists of the same clay dirt that has trapped entire caravans of birders elsewhere in the southeast, and even a seemingly-dry surface can mask a ravenous muckpit. The authors got an SUV stuck on this road, and the county mired a road grader up here.

    About:
      "<p>A birding trip to Morgan County almost inevitably centers on Jackson Reservoir. Its proximity to the Denver metro area and easy interstate highway access make it one of the most convenient Eastern Plains reservoirs for northern Front Range birders to visit. The area has hosted some spectacular rarities (see Best Birds above). &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Landbirding is best in fall, when utilization of the vast Russian Olive groves is at its maximum. Insectivores are abundant from late August into early October, as evidence by such high counts as 474 Yellow-rumped Warblers (25 Sep), 131 Wilson&#39;s Warblers (10 Sep), and 95 Yellow Warblers (5 Sep). From late Sep into winter sparrows take over the place, with counts of White-throated Sparrow reaching 15 and Harris&#39;s reaching 5. As for rarities, during the last three falls alone, such rarities as Yellow-bellied Flyatcher, Blue-headed and Philadelphia Vireos, Wood Thrush, and Mourning Warbler have been found here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Waterbirding quality depends on exposed mud during the warmer months and exposed water (that is, ice free) during the colder months. The possibilities are exemplified by the mud-rich autumns of 2012 and 2013 which produced Curlew Sandpiper, up to 8 Buff-breasted Sandpipers and 38 American Golden-Plovers, Piping Plover, Ruddy Turnstone, Laughing Gull, and Least Tern. During the same two falls, extraordinary numbers such as 4700 Baird&#39;s and 1500 Least Sandpipers have been tallied as well as 505 Lesser Yellowlegs and 211 Pectoral Sandpipers. Winter waterbirding is a gamble, but has paid off with Black Brant, American Black Duck, Iceland Gull, and Great Black-backed Gull.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  For landbirding, the best success is had by starting at the visitor center and stroling around the trees in front of, and behind. Then, proceed across the street, weaving your way north through russian olive thickets and pockets of cottonwoods to, and even past, the boat ramp. For shorebirding, it all depends on where the mud is. Access is often best from the dam/outlet channel at the southeastern corner of the lake. Be most careful if you decide to walk down the dam face and onto the mud, though the navigation is not that difficult with a bit of care. If the mud is quite low, then access via the state wildlife area at the north side of the reservoir is the best approach. Sometimes, the more marshy habitat at the northeastern part of the reservoir can be tasty; this area is best accessed from the day use parking at the Northview Campground north of the boat launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Searching for ducks and gulls is often best from the boat launch area of the state park or from the northside, accessed via the state wildlife area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Some specialty birds include Long-eared Owl in the dense Russian Olives from fall into spring (less frequent during recent years), Sabine&#39;s Gulls (not daily, but not unexpected, mostly mid-August into early October), and Mountain Plovers (fields just north of the northwestern portion of the reservoir, viewed from the reservoir, and accessed by walking west from the state wildlife area), mostly during August (not annual, but sometimes in large numbers).&lt;br /&gt;</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lake/Pond/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Marsh, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From I-76, take exit 66A. Head north on Hwy. 39 for 7.25 miles through Goodrich, then go west on Y5. After crossing the outlet canal, you have the option of turning north, following the canal to the outlet area of the dam. This is a fee area- a state parks pass (annual or daily) is required to park here. To reach the west side of the lake, keep on Y5, which will turn to the north as CR 3 and lead to the State Park entrance station after crossing the inlet canal and passing a mobile home community tucked on the SW corner of the lake. There is also access to the west end of the dam if you turn on the road south of the entrance canal. Jackson Lake SWA is on the north side of the lake. To access the SWA, backtrack to the junction of HWY 39 &amp; Y5. Continue east through the intersection. Turn north on CR 5, which skirts the reservoir to the east. At CR CC turn west. Enter the SWA by turning south at the intersection with CR 4. Parking here is free, but beginning in 2006 a state habitat stamp will be required to enter SWA lands. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>Most of this sprawling open space is open arid prairie with scattered yucca and prairie dog towns. It's not particularly good for most prairie birds, but the Ranch can be a great place to see raptors at any season (winter is best). In addition, there are a few ponds on the property that you have to hike some distance to get to, and a little bit of dry foothill scrub in a couple of places. The Sage Trail is probably the most interesting for birding; it follows a long line of mature cottonwoods and some underbrush along a canal for the better part of a mile. The trees are not themselves accessible, but they can be easily birded from the trail. </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Short-grass Prairie, Yucca, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From the junction of US 36 and CO 7 at the north end of Boulder, travel north on the combined highway about a mile and turn right on Longhorn Road (signed for Boulder Valley Ranch).

      "<p>Neenoshe Reservoir is the largest of the Indian Reservoirs and also usually the most productive. As on other eastern plains reservoirs, the water level on this lake varies enormously. When the water level is low, as it has been during the past few years, this can be a great location for shorebirds. The water level has been so consistently low that quite a bit of vegetation has grown on some of the flats, producing some great sparrow and lark habitat. The lake itself usually has large numbers of waterbirds, including, in season, enormous flocks of white geese, American White-Pelicans, ducks, and gulls. In summer, breeding grebes here can be majority Clark's. The large grove along the western edge of the lake is the world famous (well, maybe not) Locust Grove. Many a rare warbler has shown up here, and this is an essential stop on any trip to the area. The grove continues along the southern edge of the lake, but this section is usually not as productive. In the event of a fallout, though, it is probably worth a check.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Tamarisk, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> The Indian Reservoirs are south of Eads on both sides of US 287. To get to the Locust Grove at Neenoshe, turn east off of US 287 on CR E and go west 1.5 miles to CR 46. Turn north and follow the gravel road around as it swings around the southwest corner of the lake. Park where the northbound road is approached most closely by a grove of locusts and brush pushing west from the cottonwoods along the lakeshore. This is the Locust Grove. The other trees along the lakeshore, especially north of here, are worth a check. To scan the water of Neenoshe, drive to the southern parking lot, and then drive \"into\" the reservoir, until you reach the water. In recent years this requires a drive of a mile or more. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>The highlight of Windsor birding is Windsor Lake, a medium-large, deep, rocky-shored lake nearly circumnavigated by a walking trail. The main access is via Boardwalk Park in the southwest corner. The lake trail can also be accessed via the southeast corner (at the north end of Chimney Park Drive) or from the northwest corner, from which you can also scan a smaller lake on the west side of Seventh Street (CO 257). Windsor Lake can be superb or dull, depending on the shad (a small fish) population. When good, it has attracted multiple interesting large gulls (such as Glaucous, Lesser Black-backed and Thayer&#39;s) plus vast hordes of mergansers and Western/Clark&#39;s Grebes. During May 2011, two Black-legged Kittiwakes spent time here and an Arctic Tern payed a brief visit. During March 2013, among the swarms of Cackling Geese, a minima (Pacific Northwest subspecies) Cackling Goose was a one-day wonder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  If you&#39;re in Windsor during landbird migration, don&#39;t fail to check out Windsor Main Park, which has a good variety of mature deciduous shade trees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The southern part of Windsor contains Poudre Park and the adjacent Eastman Park, the current western terminus of the Poudre River Trail. The Trail currently runs along pretty marginal riparian habitat between Eastman Park and CO 257, just over a mile to the east. If you like golf course ponds, don&#39;t miss the ones both north and south of this stretch of the river.

It’s a great way to access additional hiking trails, go birding and photograph the Refuge. To begin the Drive, follow the signs after entering the Refuge. A car symbol and arrow will guide you along the way. Please be sure to pick up a Wildlife Drive/Trail Map at the Visitor Center parking lot kiosk, inside the Visitor Center or at the Wildlife Drive kiosk. Be sure to read the rules and regulations before beginning your tour. Along the route there are two parking areas with trail access. The route is not plowed in the winter and a small portion of the drive is on gravel road. For winter road conditions on the Refuge please call the Visitor Center at 303-289-0930. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Refuge has more than 10 miles of easy to moderate hiking available year-round to view and photograph wildlife.

Once the road joins Eightmile Creek there are some excellent patches of lowland riparian good for migrants. At this point the road also enters a deep, steep sided red-rock canyon.

As the road nears Teller County the PJ transitions into mixed coniferous forest, and the bird species mix changes accordingly, with Steller's Jays, Ruby-crowned Kinglets, Cassin's Finches, and others.

Hooded Merganser can also occur in great numbers during this time of year. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Marston is also a great place to study loons and grebes – it is one of the best places in the state to see multiple Pacific Loons during the fall, and Red-necked Grebe has occurred more than once. While it is not as renowned for gulls, there are often good-sized flocks here during the colder months that can include Thayer&#39;s, Glaucous, Lesser Black-backed, and maybe even rarer species. Finally, when the reservoir is low enough there are a few mudflats, especially on the southern end, which have the best shorebird potential in the county.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> For the south side, from Wadsworth and Bowles, travel north on Wadsworth to Belleview, and take a right. Follow Belleview for a short distance and take your first left onto S. Balsam St. Follow this road as it curves around and becomes W. Grand Ave. Follow Grand as it curves to the north and parallels the SE shore. Scan from any openings where you can see the reservoir. The best one is usually where Grand approaches the reservoir most closely, near the north end of the road. To reach the north end of the reservoir, take Wadsworth north to Quincy, and take a right on Quincy. Follow Quincy west to Sheridan Blvd and take a right. Head south on Sheridan to a &quot;T&quot; with Bow Mar Dr, and take a right onto Bow Mar. This road parallels the north side of the reservoir and provides good vantage points for scanning. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

The hillsides right around the parking lot (as well as farther in) have Rufous-crowned Sparrows, and the cliffs can have nesting owls. About half a mile down the trail from the parking lot, a large seep with riparian habitat surrounding it and cattails in the middle should be good for migrants, and maybe a rail or two. Just beyond the seep the trail splits. Going left will take you south a mile to the Oklahoma border through a wide cholla and yucca grassland full of Cassin's Sparrows in summer. Following the main trail the other direction, you will reach an area with many amazing rock formations, and a narrow canyon with riparian and scrubby habitat along with a permanent spring, another good spot to check for migrants, and nesting Eastern Phoebe. Be sure to follow the foot trail when approaching this area, as the horse trail skirts the good stuff.

The magnificent red cliffs here provide the perfect backdrop for newcomers to the west to spot their first Prairie Falcon, White-throated Swift, Say's Phoebe, Western Scrub-Jay, Canyon Wren, Mountain Bluebird, Virginia's Warbler, Yellow-breasted Chat, Spotted Towhee, or Lazuli Bunting. All these birds are regular in the park. Look for the falcon and the wren on the cliffs, the swifts soaring around rock faces or zooming down the gully behind the Visitor's Center, the phoebe and the bluebird in open areas, and the other birds in the riparian tangles along the base of the cliffs or along the stream. Bushtit and Western Bluebird are rare but regular. Rosy-finches used to roost on the cliffs in the winter, but they are no longer likely here. Northern Pygmy-Owl has been seen in winter in the cottonwoods along the highway bordering the east side of the park. <br /><br />Morrison Park, just across Highway 8 from Red Rocks Park, is a classic spot for American Dipper. They breed under the bridge at the west end of the parking lot and can usually be found here at any time of year. Western Scrub-Jay, Spotted Towhee and (in summer) Lesser Goldfinch and Black-headed Grosbeak can also be seen in the parking lot. <br /><br /> Adjacent to Red Rocks Park on the north and just across the street from the Dinosaur Ridge Hawkwatch is Matthews/Winters Park.

    About:
      "<p>By far the largest town in Moffat County, Craig has a number of good birding spots. Loudy Simpson Park is one of the premier migrant spots in western Colorado, and a must hit spot on any visit to Moffat County in the fall. The nature trail here begins at the northeast corner of the parking lot near the river. The trail makes an approximate half mile loop through cottonwood riparian habitat with extensive shrubby understory. The park is at its best during mid-August to late September when it acts as an effective fall migrant trap. The Loudy-Simpson nature trail is arguably one of the best migrant stopovers on the west slope. During the spring and summer months it hosts a good assortment of low elevation riparian species. <br /><br />There is also a very pleasant two mile hiking/jogging trail that makes a loop around the perimeter of the park. This trail crosses cottonwood riparian, willow and grassland habitats and makes for a nice bird walk if you have extra time. <br /><br />The portion of the oxbow lake to the east of Ranney Street is sometimes home to a family of Wood Ducks and is worth a quick look. The small pond (no public access) to the north of Loudy-Simpson Park has hosted some surprises over the years, such as Long-tailed Duck and White-winged Scoter, and can be viewed by walking over the foot bridge located at the end of the nature trail. <br /><br />Craig also has some good quick birding spots, mostly ponds that are best visited during the fall or winter: Perch Pond: The \"Perch Pond\" is located along Highway 13 about midway between Craig and Meeker and constitutes the fresh water supply for the nearby Colowyo Coal Mine. The pond is worth a quick stop to look for waterfowl and marsh birds if you happen to be passing by. <br /><br />Craig Station Inlet Pond: This pond can be reached by turning off Highway 13 onto Moffat County Road 107 about five miles south of Craig. The pond is reached by traveling about 0.6 miles east along CR 107. The pond is not accessible to the public but can be viewed from the road. Loons, grebes, mergansers and other deep water birds sometimes visit this water body during fall through spring. Barrow's Goldeneyes occasionally roost on the pond during the winter months. <br /><br />WFMC Gravel Pit: Almost directly across (west of) the intersection of Hwy 13 and CR 107 is a BLM information turnoff. From this turnoff you can view gravel pit ponds that sometimes host pelicans, Tundra Swans (on at least two occasions) and other waterfowl. If you look way back to the west with a scope you may be able to spot nesting Bald Eagles in the cottonwoods lining the river. <br /><br />Yampa River South of Craig: Along a two-mile stretch of the Yampa River, viewed from Highway 13 from the south end of Craig to a bridge over the river, variable numbers of Barrow's Goldeneyes and other waterfowl are often found during winter months. Viewing points from the highway are limited but with caution much of this river section can be viewed. The River Ridge Restaurant parking lot is a good viewing spot, but permission should probably be sought. <br /><br />Craig Golf Course Road: The Yampa Valley Golf Course is located southeast of Craig. It can be reached by driving south on Ranney Street and turning left on Highway 394 (the Airport Road). Turn left (north) on the next major road toward the golf course. The golf course road has a few small ponds, wet meadows and marshes that are sometimes good for ducks, shorebirds and rails. If you follow Hwy 394 to the east of the golf course turnoff you can observe sub irrigated native hay fields that are good for Savannah Sparrow and Sandhill Crane. On at least one occasion, Bobolinks and a Dickcissel were found on this road.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Lowland Riparian, Sagebrush</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Craig is along US-40 in easternmost Moffat County. Loudy-Simpson Park is located on the south side of Craig along the Yampa River. It can be accessed by turning off Highway 40 (Victory Way) in the center of Craig and traveling south on Ranney Street. After crossing the Yampa River, the next right (west) turn will take you into Loudy-Simpson Park. The best birding spot in the park is the Kiwanis Nature Trail located inside a Yampa River oxbow. The nature trail can be reached by turning right on the first road reached after entering the park. Take this road a quarter mile to the river. Directions to the other small sites are in the descriptions for each site, above. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>This covers the gravel pits along the South Platte corridor between about 80th and 104th Avenues, including the area sometimes referred to by birders as \"88th and the South Platte\" or \"the Dahlia ponds.\" The latter place is the premier spot for wintering waterfowl in the Metro Region. All the regular wintering dabblers and divers can usually be found with a concerted search, and a couple of Barrow's Goldeneyes are usually present, though finding them can sometimes require a long cold walk. Long-tailed Ducks have vacationed in this area a few times also, and such rarities as Little Blue Heron have toured it in spring. There is a good chance for low-density wintering waterbirds such as Killdeer, Great Blue Heron, and Double-crested Cormorant, and the weeds and brush along the river trail can harbor sparrow flocks worth checking for White-throated and Harris'. Thanks to the bird diversity, raptors including Peregrine Falcon often winter in the area. <br /><br />Many of the gravel pits in this complex can be scanned from the side of Dahlia Avenue south of 88th. Dahlia can be busy, but with caution you should be able to find places to pull over to check all the water on both sides of the road. Some ponds on the west side of the South Platte must be checked on foot. From the parking lot on the southwest corner of 88th and the South Platte, walk a half-mile south to scan a couple of ponds on the west side of the river embankment. Walk a half-mile north from the parking lot to find the pond where the Little Blue Heron spent time. West of here, on the east side of Riverdale Avenue, is a much smaller pond that may attract a few dabblers in migration. <br /><br />East of Dahlia along 88th a few more ponds become visible. The one to the south is best scanned from Dahlia. The ones to the north are best viewed from the dead end of E. 89th Avenue, which heads west from 88th as the latter street bends north towards the I-76 exit. <br /><br />Just before the I-76 exit along 88th, you can turn left (north) onto a frontage road west of I-76, then left again onto Monaco Street, which winds around and eventually becomes McKay Road. A large gravel pit well to the west is visible, but not really birdable from the road north of the exit before the river crossing. On the west side of the river, however, before 100th Avenue, there are nice gravel pit ponds on either side of McKay, which can attract good numbers of divers in migration and can be scanned quite adequately from the side of the road. The pond on the left (south) is the euphoniously named Sprat Platte Fishing Facility, operated as a park by the city of Thornton. A few smaller, less productive ponds can be found a half-mile north on the north side of 104th Avenue on either side of where it crosses the South Platte River.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Marsh, Lowland Riparian, Stream, Urban/Suburban</p><p><b>Directions:</b> This area is best reached from the 88th Avenue exit off I-76.

      "<p>This touristy town is the gateway to the rugged and beautiful San Juan Mountains. But, for birders, it is the piece de resistance of the county. Not only does it host the most accessible Black Swift colony in the state (possibly on the planet), but the extensive plantings of fruit-bearing shrubs and trees offer a haven for mis-placed and/or laggard fall migrants. The list of out-of-range species seen in town includes Tennessee Warbler, Red Fox Sparrow, Swamp Sparrow, \"White-winged\" Dark-eyed Junco, and Rose-breasted Grosbeak. Species seen here in November, later in fall than is typical for the state, include Hermit Thrush, Northern Mockingbird, Gray Catbird, Lincoln's Sparrow, and Black-headed Grosbeak. Feeders in town can support a good number and variety of finches in season, including all three rosy-finch species and Pine Grosbeak; Evening Grosbeak is particularly reliable in town. <br /><br />However, the primary attraction must be Box Canyon Park, the site of a relatively large Black Swift colony and a good diversity of breeding birds. The Park is accessed from 3rd St on the south side of town, west of US 550. The swifts nest in the box canyon and their nests are found by scanning the walls. There is an entrance fee to the Park. One can also stand anywhere in the open in town in the evening and look up and sort through the hordes of White-throated Swifts and Violet-green Swallows looking for the larger, longer-winged, and shorter-tailed shape of Black Swifts. Be prepared for \"Warbler Neck.\" <br /><br />From the south side of town, continue south on US 550 around one hairpin turn to another at which there is a road accessing the Uncompahgre National Forest. Species seen in the area include Dusky Grouse, Red-naped and Williamson's sapsuckers, and MacGillivray's Warbler. Note that this road is quite rough in places and 4WD may be a necessity.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Cliff Face, Mixed Conifer Forest, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> The town straddles US 550 about 13 road miles SSE of Ridgway. The whole town is worth birding, particularly on foot, but there are some places that seem to hold birds better than others. Third Street (on the south side of town) can be good along its entire length, with feeders east of US 550 attracting rosy-finches in winter. The area around the Wiesbaden Inn (at 4th St and 5th Ave) hosted the Red Fox Sparrow and Black-headed Grosbeak in November 2000. The drainage on the west side of US 550 and north of 9th St has twice hosted Swamp Sparrow in fall; the best viewing spot can be reached the dead-end road going north from 9th just west of US 550 or from the west end of 9th. Walking the entire length of Oak (on the west side of the Uncompahgre River) from 3rd to 7th can be fruitful (in more ways than one); Oak becomes 17 Road on the north side of Ouray (see the CR 3A/CR 3/CR 17 site account). </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

Begin birding at the bridge over the Gunnison River last several mile after turning off Highway 50. A variety of ducks, swallows, and other water birds congregate here in season. Most of the lowland riparian species can be found in the cottonwoods along the river banks, including Blue Grosbeak, Yellow Warbler, and Bullock's Oriole. New gravel mines a half-mile west of the river promise to be hotspots once mining is complete and they are allowed to fill with water. About 2 miles from the highway a nice riparian strip of cottonwoods line East Creek; these are nice migrant trap, and cliffs across the creek host Canyon Wrens . The road then climbs up through sparse pinyon-juniper woodlands, which host the expected species during the breeding season including Gray Vireo and Ash-throated Flycatcher. After climbing the hill through the PJs, a pullout on the right offers an overlook of the creek; look and listen for Belted Kingfisher, Rough-winged Swallow, and Lesser Goldfinch here. Take a short side trip into Cactus Park for Sage Sparrow, Sage Thrasher, and Brewer Sparrow. The cliffs one half-mile west of the Cactus Park road host to colony of White-throated Swifts. A rich mid-elevation riparian zone extends a quarter-mile or so above and below the first bridge over East Creek. This strip is on BLM land; Cooper's Hawk, Yellow-breasted Chat, and Lazuli Bunting are regular breeders here. Eared Grebes, Canada Geese, and a variety of ducks nest at the two Ponds just west of Unaweep Divide, and Sandhill Cranes can frequently be found in the wetlands between these two ponds. Unaweep Seep is a lush mid-elevation riparian zone that hosts all of the expected species, Including Yellow-breasted Chat (the seep also hosts a nice variety of butterflies including California Sister and Nokomis Fritillary) home. The bridges over West Creek often have nesting American Dippers, and those at 6.7 Road may represent the lowest elevation Dipper nest site in the state.

      "<p>The town of Holyoke is not only the county seat of Phillips County, and the largest town, it is also a decent birding town. The main claim to fame here is the small population of Mississippi Kites, best looked for in the town park on the west side of US 385 in the south part of town, but possible anywhere. Aforementioned town park may also be worth a look for migrants, though a lack of undergrowth limits it potential. There are many large trees in town (especially around the courthouse a few blocks north of the park), as well as some weedy lots, and any of these could attract an interesting migrant or winter resident. <br /><br />Just east of town is the Lions Club Fishing Hole. This two-acre lake is one of the largest permanent bodies of water in the county. Look for breeding Orchard Oriole and for migrants in the small tangles on the east and south sides. Lark Sparrow and swallows are common in the area in summer. The small lake is popular with people but probably also gets ducks in migration. <br /><br />Just south and west of the fishing hole are the Holyoke Sewage Ponds, which can only be scanned by standing on top of your car. The ponds have been criscrossed with thin wire in 4-foot square sections to discourage waterfowl from landing on the ponds, but resident Canada Geese can still be found here, and Killdeer and Spotted Sandpiper breed. Also be sure to check out the wet area with cattails where CR 41 crosses a creek just north of the ponds. While this area looks to small for rails to breed, they may stop over during migration, and sparrows or a Marsh Wren could make use of the spot. <br /><br />Half a mile south of the sewage ponds on the same road is the Holyoke Cemetery, which may attract migrant landbirds from time to time. <br /><br />US-385 north of Holyoke, and CRs 38 and 29 pass through some good grasslands with most of the associated species, as well as Burrowing Owl.

      "<p>There are no tamaracks in Colorado, so the name is a mystery, but nevertheless this enormous and varied SWA is probably among the top ten SWAs in Colorado, and certainly not a spot to be missed during the summertime. Tamarack can be frustrating to bird thoroughly, especially the eastern portion where there are multiple large hedgerows that take a lot of time to check, and any of which could be hopping or dead. Northern Cardinal has been seen here, and White-throated and Harris&#39;s Sparrows are possible during the winter. Ring-necked Pheasant, Bell&#39;s Vireo, Yellow-breasted Chat, Blue Grosbeak, Field Sparrow (especially in the surrounding grassland) and Baltimore Oriole are possible during the breeding season. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The more extensively wooded western portion of the SWA, which includes a large stretch of riverside trees and brush, usually has better birding. This is probably the best place in the state for Baltimore Oriole, along with Bullock&#39;s and everything in between. Bell&#39;s Vireos are common along the road, and both Northern Cardinal and Red-bellied Woodpeckers can be found in the woods. Look for Eastern Phoebe nesting under the bridge over the South Platte, and for Bobolink in the fields on the south side of the road a mile or so down. The most complicated issue here are the towhees – many people have reported Eastern Towhee from here, but Tamarack is in the middle of the hybrid zone, so be very careful when IDing this species, and be sure to use both visual and aural clues. Tamarack is also the best place in the state to look for Black-billed Cuckoo, but it is rare even here, and can be confused with young Yellow-billed Cuckoo. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Tamarack SWA also includes some large tracts south of I-76, most of which are prairie. A while back Sharp-tailed Grouse and Greater Prairie-Chickens were introduced to this part of the SWA, and some may still be here, but access to this area is tricky and finding the chickens is not easy, even if you decide they are &amp;quot;countable.&amp;quot; To get to a traditional site for breeding Cassin&#39;s Sparrow, follow CO 55 south of I-76 a while until you get into the sagebrush habitat--the birds can be fairly common here.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt</p><p><b>Directions:</b> The best way to reach Tamarack is to take I-76 to exit 149 (the Crook exit) and go north on CO 55 from the exit ramp.

      "<p>Neeskah Reservoir, also known as Upper Queens Reservoir, is probably the reservoir that gets the most shorebirds. When the water level is low enough to create mudflats, be sure to check the western edge of the lake via the multitude of confusing access points. Neeskah can also be good for ducks, gulls, and an astounding number of Black Terns, in season. The often-underestimated grove on the southern end of the reservoir can be well worth a stop. Many a good migrant has been seen here, and one can usually find the resident Barn Owl. <br /><br />Lower Queens Reservoir is the \"Neenothing\" reservoir. In addition to being nee-less, it also rarely produces much of interest birdwise. The structure of the lake is such that even when the water is low it has no mudflats. However, there are often good numbers of ducks and occasionally gulls on the lake, so something good could show up. The few trees with tons of tamarisk that line the lake may attract a migrant or two in season. <br /><br />On the road between Upper and Lower Queens are a few small trees that, while they don't look like much, have actually gotten a good bird or two. They only take a couple of minutes to check, and who knows, maybe you'll find a Prairie Warbler. Look on the grasslands along this road for Cattle Egret during the spring and summer, and prairie longspurs during spring migration. <br /><br />Finally, a note about the last of the Indian Reservoirs--King Reservoir, in Prowers County, is not only hard to scan well, but in fact I have yet to see a bird on it.

      "<p>Starting just east of the tiny town of Fort Lyon is the enormous Fort Lyon Wildlife Easement. Birding this area thoroughly can take some time, but it&#39;s well worth it. As with any migrant trap, it can be completely dead or hopping with migrants. Almost everything has appeared here, from flocks containing multiple eastern rarities to mountain species invading the plains. There is a pair of resident Barn Owls that can usually be found on any thorough check of the grove. Western Screech-Owl breeds here as well, but you are only likely to hear it at night. Northern Bobwhites can often be flushed from the more open areas of the easement, and Scaled Quail has been seen also. If the area is hopping, be sure to check the small finger of trees across CR 16 from the main part of the easement. A good bird or two has been found in this area as well. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Just across CR HH from the FLWE is another small grove, this one centered around a small inlet canal. This grove is not as famous for rarities, but flocks do appear here as well. Northern Cardinal is occasionally found here in the winter, along with good-sized sparrow flocks. The canal often has multiple Wilson&#39;s Snipe along it, and has produced Green Heron before. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Starting at the corner of CRs HH and 16 are the John Martin Marshes, an amazingly large area of cattails spreading from here at least a couple of miles to the east, and measuring a couple of miles wide in some places. The most famous resident of this marsh is Black Rail, of which one can often hear 15 or 20 along CR 16 on a night in May. The rails usually arrive in very late April, and can be heard through early to mid August. Other species usually heard at the marsh include Marsh Wren, Virginia Rail, Sora, and American Bittern. Even Least Bittern, Common Moorhen and King Rail have been heard here before. On the edges of this marsh, in the winter, there are occasionally multiple Swamp and LeConte&#39;s Sparrows among the more common Song Sparrows, and Savannah Sparrow has been seen during a couple of winters. An amazing number of rails occur here in the winter, with this probably being the only regular place for wintering Sora in Colorado. Short-eared Owls are also present during some winters, but given the size of the marsh, and the amazing number of Harriers that occur here, chances of seeing one are slim. Blackbird flocks that frequent the marsh in the winter can be the best place in the area to find wintering Yellow-headed Blackbirds, Brown-headed Cowbirds, and Common Grackles. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Grove at JJ and 16, also known as the Wood Thrush Grove, is a small area of trees at the corner of CRs JJ and 16. Usually you will not see much here, but during good migration fallouts there may be a good bird or two to be found here. Be sure to bird the trees on both sides of CR JJ. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Van&#39;s Grove is a little over a mile east of the Wood Thrush Grove on CR JJ. While one would not think this collection of small trees would be a great migrant trap, almost as many good migrants have been see here over the years as at the FLWE. You will not want to miss this spot if there are any migrants in the area. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  CR JJ has a number of good vantage points from which to check out the marsh, and, if you are here at night, hear more rails.

      "<p>For being as close to Chatfield as it is, Waterton Canyon hosts a dramatically different set of habitats. Species that very rarely occur at Chatfield are common here, such as Canyon Wren and, higher up, Pygmy Nuthatch. The riparian habitat in the lower part of the canyon might be worth a look for migrants in season, and the expected breeding species such as Bullock's Oriole, Yellow Warbler, House Wren and maybe even a Least Flycatcher during the summer. The thick foothills scrub on the hillsides is excellent for Virginia's Warbler, Yellow-breasted Chat, Lazuli and possibly Indigo Buntings and Spotted Towhee. A pair or two of American Dippers can usually be found along the river with a bit of searching. <br /><br />A little further up the habitat blends into Ponderosa woodland, and species more typical of this habitat start appearing, such as Hairy Woodpecker, Pygmy and Red-breasted Nutatches, Pine Siskin and others. The canyon slowly rises the further upstream you go, and eventually you will reach a small reservoir, Strontia Springs Reservoir. This is usually as far as most people hike. The upper part of this hike can sometimes produce Northern Pygmy-Owl during the winter, and the lower portions host Eastern Screech-Owl, but both owls are exceedingly hard to find. <br /><br />During the entire hike you should hear many Rock and Canyon Wrens, see a ton of White-throated Swifts zooming overhead (in summer), and maybe even see a Prairie Falcon or Golden Eagle soaring on the thermals.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Foothill Shrub, Lowland Riparian, Ponderosa Forest, Mixed-Conifer Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Take the Wadsworth exit off of C-470 and follow it south past the entrance for Chatfield, to a left turn onto Waterton Rd.

      "<p>This is an essential stop for birders driving I-70. If you bird Kit Carson County for long, chances are 75% of your county list will come from this location. Water levels in the lake can be low in both spring and fall, making this a good location for shorebirds. Normally a few small rafts of ducks containing mostly dabblers can be found on the lake in season, but often the species that make up these rafts change with each visit. <br /><br />The extensive riparian groves around the reservoir are the real reason to visit this SWA. Be sure not to neglect the trees along the creek south of the reservoir. Spring and fall can produce large migrant flocks, including eastern vagrants. Winter is a good time check for sparrows, finches, and waxwings (especially in the small juniper hedgerow in the NE corner), and flicker numbers can be truly phenomenal. Wild Turkeys occasionally cross the road near the trees. <br /><br />There is also a juniper hedgerow below the dam, as well as a great riparian corridor, probably the best in the area. This area is made up of large mature cottonwoods and willows, but unfortunately cows have removed most of the underbrush. The grove has breeding Red-headed Woodpecker, Eastern Kingbird, and Eastern Bluebird, and this is where most of the best migrants have been found in the past. A barbed-wire fence on the east side of this area makes it looks uninviting, but the fence is not complete; you can just walk around it. <br /><br />There are a couple of auxiliary locations to check while you are in the area. The first is the two small ponds just NW of the dam, accessed by a fairly passable two-track. These ponds are behind a fence and some distance from the two-track, but they can be scanned with difficulty from the edge of the public property. The ponds usually have more ducks than the actual reservoir. Cassin's and Brewer's Sparrows breed in the grasslands here as well. Another location to check is the large but privately-owned row of mature conifers on the south side of the road just west of the lake. You can't walk in them, but you can bird them from the county road.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Flagler Reservoir can be reached from both the east and the west.

      "<p>The Canon City Riverwalk currently extends close to 3 miles, much of it adjacent to the Arkansas River right through the middle of Canon City. It will be expanded another mile further west by around 2007. Bicycles and equestrian use is allowed, but it is strictly non-motorized. It can be accessed at the following four locations: 9th Street and Sells Avenue, the current western portal where parking is available; Raynolds Ave just south of the River, where several parking lots are available; Ash Street hill access, with parking on the side of the street for several cars; and McKenzie Ave access, the eastern portal with a parking lot. <br /><br />There are four trail segments. Between McKenzie Ave and Ash Street Hill is the least traveled trail. Much of this segment runs adjacent to the river, and except for a fairly steep but less than 100-foot section near Ash Street, it is level. The segment from Ash Street Hill to Raynolds Ave, though near the river, also runs next to the street and is therefore noisy, but it does run adjacent to a slough where Sora and Virginia Rail have been found. Between Raynolds Ave and 9th Street the River Trail runs adjacent to the river most of its length and is also adjacent to the wetland/pond area where Green Herons can be seen. This is also the most popular segment with the most use. The segment from Raynolds to 9th Street Bluff runs along the base of the bluff, but is located adjacent to seasonal wetlands on both sides near Raynolds Ave. There are also some dirt trails of varying lengths between the Raynolds Ave and 9th Street area in a section referred to as John Griffin Park. <br /><br />Birding is good all year round; and the weather is Canon City is the most moderate in Colorado (as verified by the Weather Service), which facilitates birding in all seasons between Ash Street and McKenzie Ave. Plumbeous Vireo, Blue Grosbeak, Lazuli Bunting, Yellow-breasted Chat, Common Yellowthroat, Yellow Warbler and Bullock's Oriole regularly breed in many sections of the Riverwalk. Gray Catbird has also bred here in recent years, as has Rose-breasted Grosbeak since 2004. Cooper's Hawks have bred both on the east and west ends of the Riverwalk with recent nesting almost directly above the Bluff Trail. The Riverwalk has been quite reliable for Green Herons from May to Sept with breeding probable. During spring migration Black and Eastern Phoebes have frequently been seen along the Ash Street to McKenzie Ave segment. More commonly seen birds include Great Blue Herons year-round, waterfowl including Green, Cinnamon and Blue-winged Teal mostly in winter, Yellow-rumped Warblers both spring and fall, White-crowned Sparrows in winter, Osprey in summer and Bald Eagles in winter.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Urban/Suburban</p><p><b>Directions:</b> All the access points mentioned above are most easily reached from US-50 in Canon City. To reach the western access point to the riverwalk, take US-50 into the center of town and turn south on 9th St. Cross over the river and park on the left by Sells Ave. To reach the Raynolds Ave access points, turn right onto Raynolds Ave on the east side of town and follow it south, across the river, to various parking lots on the left side of the road. The Ash hill access can be reached by taking Raynolds Ave off of US-50 to Main St. (the first road you come to), and taking a left (east) onto Main St. Follow Main St. to your next right (Rhodes Ave) and head south and then east as the road curves, and take a right onto Ash St. Follow Ash St. south to where it overlooks the river to the parking lot. The eastern access can be reached by heading south from US-50 on McKenzie Ave, about three-quarters of a mile east of town. Follow McKenzie to the parking lot, on the right. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

While this area is surely great during the summer for riparian breeders which can be hard to get elsewhere in the county, the true draw to this location is its migrant potential. The greenbelt is reminiscent of its northern relative, the Wheat Ridge Greenbelt. Be sure to look in the occasional small pond for ducks, the small cattail marshes for rails, and in the brushy field edges for sparrows. Eastern Screech-Owl is a good possibility in the areas with thicker trees. Also listen for species such as Bushtit and Lesser Goldfinch, both hard to get in Denver County, but both possible here. Given how long and linear this location is, and the presence of a great bike path, the best way to bird this place is on a bicycle.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Urban/Suburban</p><p><b>Directions:</b> The eastern portions of the greenbelt in Denver County can be accessed from the south, by taking Hampden to Sheridan, and heading south on Sheridan.

      "<p>Many sections of Boulder Creek provide excellent birding year-round, but arguably the most famous part stretches about two miles from 6th Street on the west to Folsom Avenue on the east, running along the south edge of downtown Boulder and the north edge of the CU-Boulder campus. Worth a check at any time of year, this area is particularly productive during spring migration. Its birdlist is as long as your arm, with rare eastern vagrants from the elbow down. <br /><br />A bike trail (the Boulder Creek Path, not to be confused with either of the South Boulder Creek Trails, q.q.v.) runs along the creek throughout this section and far beyond in both directions. In many areas, informal trails provide better access to the brush or to the creek itself. In general it is okay to bird these trails, but beware damaging the habitat and trespassing on private property. <br /><br /> The west end of this area, around 6th Street, has some of the more mature trees and some of the thickest underbrush, and can be excellent for migrants. As you walk east towards (and eventually under) the library, the trees and brush thin out considerably. Ironically, the area immediately adjacent to the library has produced some of the creek's most famous vagrants, including a singing male Cape May Warbler that stayed for several days in May 2004. Do not give this section short shrift! <br /><br /> East of the library the creekpath crosses under Broadway and then runs just south of the Boulder High School campus. This section does not tend to be very birdy, but west of 17th Street the path starts to get more productive. Between 17th and Folsom, three footbridges cross the creek to campus. Between the western two footbridges, on the south side of the creek, is a terrific small wooded area crisscrossed by footpaths. This may be the best-known migrant trap in Boulder; Eastern Screech-Owl is resident. As the patch lies at the foot of the hill topped by the CU Recreation Center, it is often simply referred to as \"below the Rec Center.\" Good habitat extends east nearly to Folsom. <br /><br />Parking can be a problem in this area of Boulder. Most birders choose to park in the public library lot, since parking here is free before 9:00 AM. After 9:00 AM you must buy a parking pass. If school is not in session, the Boulder High School parking lot can be a good place to park. Some free curbside parking is available south of Arapahoe along 19th. There are also a few metered public spaces right along the creekpath in CU lot 169, on the north side of the creek and the west side of Folsom. These sites often fill, however, so be prepared to walk some distance if you're headed to the Rec Center area.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> This section of the Boulder Creek Path runs through downtown Boulder.

      "<p>Valmont is merely the largest of the three reservoirs in this complex, the others being Hillcrest and Leggett-Owen. The Valmont complex is Boulder County's premier winter waterbird spot, since the Excel power plant usually keeps some water in these lakes open all winter. They can harbor large numbers of winter ducks of many species, and they often have small numbers of other birds that normally winter farther south, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, Great Blue Herons and Killdeer. Most of Boulder County's winter gulls roost on Valmont, although not too many stick around during the day. Scoping from the open space at dusk is a good way to pick out rare gulls. When there is a very cold snap, Valmont may be the only open water in the area, and the concentrations of birds here can be astounding. Waterbird numbers may vary widely from one day to the next. <br /><br />The area around the lakes is good for raptors in winter; Bald Eagle is common, Golden Eagle is uncommon, and Ferruginous Hawk is quite regular. Great Horned Owls have nested in the box that Excel has mounted high on the side of its smokestack, and Barn Owl has nested in an old Wood Duck box visible (at a tremendous distance) from Legion Park. <br /><br />The reservoirs can be birded from two locations. From dawn to dusk they can be scoped from Legion Park to the south. This provides a good view of Hillcrest Reservoir and the only possible view of Leggett-Owen Reservoir, which is quite distant. Valmont Reservoir itself can only be partially scanned from Legion Park, and always at a great distance. Scoping all the trees and power poles from this vantage point gives you a decent shot at turning up both eagles in winter. <br /><br />During weekday business hours (and occasionally and irregularly at other times) you can drive into the Open Space headquarters, park and walk west along the south shore of Valmont Reservoir. This is the best way to bird Valmont itself, and this is where you want to be to catch the incoming gulls on a winter evening. If the gate is not open you can park in front of it on the west side of 75th Street (being careful not to block the gate) and walk about three quarters of a mile out to the scanning spot.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Grassland/Prairie, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Legion Park (open dawn to dusk) is on the north side of Arapahoe Road (CO 7) on the east side of Boulder, about 2.5 miles east of Foothills Parkway (CO 157) and 0.5 miles west of 75th Street.

      "<p>This City of Boulder park charges an entrance fee during the summer, but not during the winter. This is fortuitous for birders, as the colder months are definitely the better ones for birding here. Being the largest body of water in the county, Boulder Reservoir attracts rare waterbirds at a high rate. Loons, grebes and diving ducks are a good bet in migration, and jaegers and rare gulls and terns have shown up on occasion. Ospreys breed along the west shore, which is seasonally closed for that reason. From the east end of the entrance road, if you so desire, you can walk the dam north to get better views of distant birds. The main entrance road runs along the south shore of Boulder Reservoir and the north shore of the smaller Sixmile Reservoir, which can also be excellent for birds. For alternate access to Boulder Reservoir, you can park at one of the other parking lots, which will get you out of paying the entrance fee. One is in the northwest corner of the reservoir along 51st Street, and the other is in the northeast corner along 75th Street. Both require you to walk a quarter to a half mile in order to scan the water.

      "<p>This is a private ranch located out on the plains and straddling the El Paso/Pueblo County line. Day passes are $15 per person, and for groups over 6, $10 per person. Yearly passes are available. Birding is open year round. For those interested in going birding on the Chico Basin Ranch, follow directions to the ranch HDQ where a kiosk can be found. Detailed instructions are available at the kiosk. Visitors will be asked to fill out a liability waiver and a registration form. Bird lists, birding trail, map and ranch policies and rules are available at the HDQ check in station. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The bulk of the ranch is in Pueblo County but there is an excellent migrant trap on the El Paso side where Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory bands birds each spring. There are also 5 warm water, spring-fed lakes, which can provide some interesting waterbirds on occasion. The area on the El Paso side that is birded consists of a huge grove of Russian Olives with a few Peachleaf Willows and a number of large Plains Cottonwoods. One of the Cottonwoods has hosted a Golden Eagle nest over the years. The banding station area is near the Holmes residence and is probably the most birded spot on the El Paso side. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Casita is just southwest of the Holmes and also provides excellent birding. Most of the warbler species that have occurred in Colorado have been recorded here and in some years there are amazing numbers of thrushes that pass through (e.g., 1200 Swainson&#39;s Thrushes on 20 May 2000). Long-eared Owls can be found in migration and even Flammulated has occurred -- twice! -- during spring migration. Common Poorwills are usually found in migration and even a Whip-poor-will has been recorded in this area. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  From the Holmes house, the olive stand bends to the southeast to a nice set of Plains Cottonwoods that have hosted many warblers over the years. This area also usually has some water where one can find Wilson&#39;s Snipe. Apart from the riparian area, there is good semi-desert shrubland that supports such species as Scaled Quail, Ladder-backed Woodpecker, Greater Roadrunner, Curve-billed Thrasher, Cassin&#39;s Sparrow, and Brewer&#39;s Sparrow. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  For the most part, the Ranch is fairly slow outside of migration periods but can still be a fun place to bird. For instance, in the winter there are usually a handful of Chestnut-collard Longspurs mixed in with the Lapland Longspurs. The other interesting winter bird is Loggerhead Shrike which is found annually in the winter yet there are only two Ranch records for Northern Shrike and both of those were migrant birds. So you can count on seeing something fun on every trip to the Ranch. With over 275 species recorded as of May 2005 you have a good chance of seeing something that interests you. </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Grassland/Prairie, Cholla, Lowland Riparian, Pond</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From I-25 take Exit 122 East.

Mountain Plovers can be seen occasionally at Hugo. The area below the dam is surprisingly productive during migration. Although there is not much there, it seems to produce. Like Kinney, the lake is very small and fished a lot so very few waterbirds are found here. You can travel further south into the SWA and find a few more small ponds and trees that usually do not have anybody else at them.

This body of water is viewable from 2G road. Camping is free at this location. <br /><br />A private pond just west of CR 32 near Hugo SWA has produced more waterfowl than any other location in Lincoln County that has been explored by this author.

      "<p>Perhaps the best high desert birding destination in western Colorado, this area is nearly in Utah! The canyons in the Rabbit Valley area south of I-70 lead to the Colorado River through scenic and varied terrain, while Brewster Ridge to the north takes you into the heart of the Grand Valley desert country that straddles the state line. Vegetation ranges from riparian along the river to saltbush-greasewood, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodland and combinations of all the above. Rabbit Valley specialties include Gray Vireo, Black-Throated Sparrow, Pinyon Jay, Rock Wren, and Gray Flycatcher. More difficult to find to downright lucky are Chukar, Burrowing Owl, Long-billed Curlew, Cassin's Kingbird, and Mountain Plover. Brewster Ridge provides the best opportunities in Western Colorado for Scott's Oriole, and is probably the most reliable place in Mesa County for Northern Mockingbird. Pronghorn antelope, Ord's kangaroo rats, white-tailed prairie dogs, and leopard lizards add variety for visitors. Additional attractions in the Rabbit Valley area include petroglyphs in McDonald Canyon (along a two-mile trek to the Colorado River) and the \"Trail Through Time\" where you can see dinosaur fossils in place in the rock along the trail. Convenience store/gas stations are located in Mack and Loma, nine and 13 miles east respectively on I-70. Highline State Park north of Loma has a nice shady campground. For motels and restaurants, you'll need to go further east to Fruita and Grand Junction.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Sagebrush, Pinyon-Juniper Forest,</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Take I-70 west to Exit 2. For Rabbit Valley, turn left and go south, several different roads take you through the area. Four-wheel drive with decent clearance is recommended if you plan to go very far. For Brewster Ridge, turn right of I-70, then at the trailhead for the \"Trail Through Time,\" turn left, paralleling I-70 as you climb a gravel road that tops out on a ridge above I-70. Begin looking here for Black-Throated Sparrow, then stay right into the scattered junipers and look for Scott's Oriole. If you don't spot orioles here, come back out of the juniper area and proceed north until you come to the paved M.8 Road (old US 6&50, the main road to get to Salt Lake, Reno, or Las Vegas before I-70 was built). Turn right (east) to 1.8 Road, turn left, and go a mile of so and turn right on 2 Road which takes you up Brewster Ridge. Once you reach the top, take 2.8 Road north out Brewster Ridge and look for Scott's Orioles near scattered junipers. You should be able to find a Mockingbird in this area as well. Four-wheel drive is not necessary for Brewster Ridge in dry conditions. All bets are off if there's been significant recent rain, or if you are receiving significant rain. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

This natural area on the border of Broomfield isn't usually very productive for waterbirds, although numbers of ducks are sometimes decent and Trumpeter Swan has shown up.

Goodies including Palm and Chestnut-sided Warblers and Eastern Phoebe have been found here. Great Horned Owl can often be found roosting in the grove, and it should be checked for Eastern Screech-Owl.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From I-25 exit 225, go west on 136th Avenue one half mile to Huron Street.

      "<p>This large state park is popular with visitors from Denver. It can be an excellent spot for mid-elevation mountain birds. Mountain Base Road (CR 1) plunges at a 19% grade down the length of the park from north to south. Along the way it accesses some nice mature Ponderosa habitat, the best of it along the Mountain Lion Trail starting at the Bootleg Bottom Trailhead. Pygmy Nuthatch is common here and the trail has potential to produce Flammulated Owl. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  More Ponderosa can be found around the Ole Barn Knoll Trailhead just to the south. At the bottom of the road lies Kriley Pond, typically waterbirdless, and the similarly handicapped Slough Pond. Both ponds, however, are surrounded by wet meadows and willows good for Lincoln&#39;s Sparrow, Wilson&#39;s Warbler and the like. The nearby park Visitor&#39;s Center has some very nice nature trails through pondside willows and mixed coniferous forests. Aspen Meadows Campground is aptly named: it is adjacent to some large meadows and a few extensive young aspen groves. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The road into the campground leads downslope a half mile to the trailhead for Dude&#39;s Fishing Hole, a small artificial lake only a short distance down the trail. It is unlikely to attract much besides an occasional Mallard or Spotted Sandpiper, but the willow, aspen and wet meadow habitats below the dam are excellent. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Buffalo Trail leaves from Gap Road near the Jefferson County line. Only the first few hundred yards of the trail are in Gilpin County. Jefferson County starts somewhere near the remains of an old log cabin on the west side of the trail. The campground and the Gilpin County section of the trail are surrounded by young lodgepole forest with a few aspens; the creek which follows the trail, however, supports some nice willow riparian habitat good for MacGillivray&#39;s and Wilson&#39;s Warblers. Townsend&#39;s Warblers and other high-elevation migrants can be found here in late summer and early fall. The Jefferson County portion of this trail gets into open meadows and ponderosa pine forest. It should be checked at night in May and June for Flammulated Owl. </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lodgepole Forest, Ponderosa Forest, Aspen Grove, Stream, Streamside Willow, Wet Meadow, Mountain Meadow, Pond/Lake/Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Aspen Meadows Campground, the Buffalo Trail, and the top of Mountain Base Road can all be accessed from Gap Road, which heads east from CO 119 about nine miles south of Nederland.

Headquarters is located south of Highway 318 within a mile of the Utah border. There is a self-guided tour of the refuge. In addition to marshes and open pond areas, there are cottonwood riparian areas and extensive sagebrush and saltbush habitats. A hunting blind on the largest pond along the auto-tour route is a great place to scan for ducks. During migration many hundreds of individuals of many species can be seen here. Browns Park NWR is also probably the best place in the state to see Tundra Swans, as their migration route just clips this remote corner of Colorado. Willow thickets along the river by the auto tour loop host breeding Willow Flycatchers, and the cottonwoods along various drainages may be good for migrants.<p>Cliffs along the river host Canyon Wrens and nesting raptors, and look like prime habitat for Black Phoebe. By heading over the really cool \"Swinging Bridge\" you can access many extremely remote and wonderful draws that very, very few birders ever see. These draws are filled with PJ and thick manzanita woodland found nowhere else in Colorado, and all the typical PJ species could be found in the area. The road on the south side of the Green River here also allows for scanning of some additional shallow ponds and marshes, which are great places to look for more ducks and shorebirds, including Black-necked Stilt (which breeds here).<p>The NWR headquarters, which are reached by heading south from SR-318 just west of the entrance to the auto-loop, usually have hummingbird feeders up, with many Black-chinned Hummingbirds during the summer, and the other three regulars during the fall. Eurasian Collared-Dove has been seen here as well. The brushy draw below the headquarters is excellent for land birds, including breeding Yellow-breasted Chat, Virginia's Warbler, Black-throated Gray Warbler, and many others.<p>A final location to check in the area is the Browns Park Store, which is reached by turning north off of SR-318 east of the NWR. The hummingbird feeders here often attract Black-chinned Hummingbirds during the summer, and the other three regulars during the fall.<p>This remote site is under birded and likely hosts much more birding potential than is currently reported.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Marsh, Rimrock/Mesa, Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Sagebrush</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Browns Park is south of SR-318, 60 miles NW of Maybell.

From here you can head either east or west; east will take you to the sites described above.

      "<p>These trails, which start just across the road from one another, are two of the most popular birding spots in Boulder. Doudy Draw's main claim to fame is spring migration, although late summer regularly draws wandering Cassin's Kingbirds and Northern Mockingbirds, both rare in Boulder County. In spring, check riparian habitats for all sorts of migrant foothill birds, from towhees to Empids to tanagers, and expect good numbers of Indigo/Lazuli/hybrid buntings and maybe a vagrant eastern warbler. The first nice tangle is on the right (west) side of the trail, a quarter mile from the trailhead. Farther on, the trail crosses the creek, and the riparian habitat is excellent from that point onward for at least the next quarter mile. Upland habitats in this area are good for Say's Phoebe and the like. Bullock's Oriole and Blue Grosbeak can be expected throughout the summer.<p>Across the road, the riparian area right around the <a class href=\"http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3035&Itemid=1035\" target=\"blank\">Mesa Trail</a> parking lot can be counted on to deliver many of the same goodies, along with maybe a dipper if the stream is running high. Eastern Screech-Owl can be heard here sometimes after dark or just before dawn. Several trails lead up into the foothills from here, and all can be birdy. This is one of the best places in the county to come hunting for Bushtit or maybe Western Bluebird, and a couple pairs of Northern Pygmy-Owls usually nest up in the conifers--you might be able to whistle one up at any time of year. If you get up near the cliffs, keep an eye and an ear out for nesting Peregrine and Prairie Falcons in addition to Canyon Wrens and a foothill avifauna similar to that of the adjacent Chautauqua Park.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Stream, Foothill Shrub, Grassland/Prairie, Ponderosa Forest, Cliff Face</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Boulder, take Broadway (CO 93) south out of town a few miles to its intersection with Eldorado Canyon Road (CO 170).

    About:
      "<p>Although the majority of the park and preserve lies in Saguache County, the part accessible by passenger vehicle is almost entirely in Alamosa County. (The county line runs due east-west just north of the campground loop.) The sand dunes themselves, though magnificently scenic, support no vegetation and thus essentially no birdlife. The rest of the park is another matter. The hillsides along the main park road access excellent pinyon-juniper forest, as does the campground loop. Any of the PJ in the park could produce Pinyon Jay, Bushtit, Mountain Bluebird and many other species. A couple of streams escape the Sangres along the entrance road, and stringers of riparian habitat follow them some distance out onto the plains. In the riparian areas look for Red-naped Sapsucker, Downy Woodpecker, Dusky and Cordilleran Flycatchers, Spotted Towhee, and Lewis&amp;#39; Woodpecker (populations variable). A semi-recent burn across the road from the Visitor Center may be worth special attention if you are looking for woodpeckers. If you have time to hike, the Mosca Pass trail is highly recommended. In addition to the habitats already mentioned it also samples good mixed-conifer forest and various montane shrubland and willow habitats. Those with sturdy legs should be able to get up into areas with Hammond&amp;#39;s Flycatcher, Wilson&amp;#39;s Warbler, Lincoln&amp;#39;s Sparrow and the like. A Winter Wren was found singing two miles up this trail in June 2005.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Lowland Riparian, Burn Area, Foothill Shrub, Sagebrush, Mixed Conifer Forest, Streamside Willow</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From US 160 fourteen miles east of Alamosa and five miles west of Blanca, turn north on CO 150 and proceed about sixteen miles north to the park entrance.

      "<p>If you are not a Boulder County Residents and do not have Boulder license plate, there is a $3   parking fee for Boulder Mountain Parks. This is enforced! The Gregory Canyon lot is tiny and typically full. If so, park out along the road somewhere and walk in. Please check current regulations in <a class href=\"http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1157&Itemid=418\" target=\"blank\">Boulder County</a>.<p>   If you follow Baseline Road in Boulder all the way west until it runs into the foothills, you will find yourself at the entrance road to Gregory Canyon, which may be the finest patch of riparian foothill habitat in the Front Range. It is one of the only places in Colorado with a native stand of Ironwood, a trademark tree of the eastern deciduous forests. Perhaps because of the familiar flora, this area seems to act as a magnet for eastern vagrants, which have included Red-shouldered Hawk, Ovenbird and Blue-winged and Prothonotary Warblers. White-eyed Vireo, Hooded and Kentucky Warblers have summered in the area, and the vireos may have fledged young! In the warmer months, Gregory Canyon is an excellent place to find specialty foothill and riparian birds like Gray Catbird, Yellow-breasted Chat, and Virginia's and MacGillivray's Warblers, all mixed with birds of drier ponderosa habitats like Western Tanager and Plumbeous Vireo, not to mention cliff-loving birds like Canyon Wren and Golden Eagle. Trails split off from the parking lot in several directions, and each of them is worth birding, particularly for the first hundred yards or so. Don't neglect the entrance road either. The draw along the lower portion of the Amphitheater Trail is worth particular attention.<p>Adjacent to Gregory Canyon on the south and southeast is Chautauqua Park, one of the more popular recreational areas in Boulder, with multiple trailheads. From Gregory or Chautauqua you can access the Mesa Trail (q.v.) and walk all the way south to Doudy Draw if you so desire. Chautauqua's trails offer most of the same birding opportunities as Gregory Canyon, minus the fabulous riparian stuff.<p>On the other side of Gregory Canyon is Flagstaff Mountain, which is where you'll end up if you follow Baseline up the hill past the entrance road to Gregory. Flagstaff Mountain Road is spectacularly steep, winding, and narrow, and it is made narrower by the crowds of masochistic bikers huffing their way uphill on the right and down on the left. Be very careful of them while driving. The various lookouts and trailheads along the road are good for scenery and for the more common Ponderosa birds. Owling from this road in spring can sometimes produce Northern Saw-whet and even Flammulated Owls, both usually heard far below you, in upper Gregory Canyon, from one of the overlooks.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Ponderosa Forest, Foothill Shrub, Lowland Riparian, Cliff Face, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Denver, follow US 36 into Boulder, exiting at Baseline Road.

      "<p>By far the best birding location in Hinsdale County, these small lakes can hold a surprising number of waterfowl and other species. Most common dabblers can be seen here in season, along with Eared Grebe, Spotted Sandpiper, all swallows except for Bank, Belted Kingfisher, and some divers including Redhead, Ring-necked Duck, and Lesser Scaup. The willows just below this lake hold Fox Sparrows and Red-naped Sapsuckers, and Savannah Sparrow has been seen in the grassy areas near the bathroom. The marshes on the west end of the lakes provides your best shot in the county at Sora and Virginia Rail. The highest elevation breeding colony of Black-crowned Night-Herons in the state is at the nearby Hermit Lakes, and these birds can often be seen at Browns Lakes. Bald Eagles are fairly common in the area in the late fall and probably the spring as well. <br /><br />A few miles beyond Brown Lakes up the mountain is FR 514, which runs through some nice spruce-fir forest. Three-toed Woodpecker was quite common here in 2005.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Mixed Conifer Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Lake City, go south on CO 149 for 26.5 miles to FR 515, on the right (3.5 miles north of the Mineral/Hinsdale county line).

    About:
      "<p>This ribbon of riparian habitat is the undisputed crown jewel of southwestern birding locations.  Yellow Jacket Creek has water flowing through it all year, and an extensive riparian corridor lines it for at least two miles.  Unfortunately, much of it, including the best stuff, is on private property.<br/><br/>The reason most birders come here is to look for Lucy's Warbler, first discovered breeding here in 2004 and seen in numbers every summer since then.  A pair typically nests right on the public property boundary (see below), and up to three other pairs have been seen upstream from there on public land. They usually arrive in late April and are present through July, though they get increasingly harder to find after mid-June.<br/><br/>Lucy's Warblers are far from the only reason to come, though.  Summer Tanagers have maintained territories here in 2006 and 2007 and likely breed; rarities such as Yellow-throated Vireo have been seen, and the potential here is phenomenal.  Gray Vireo is common along the road in, along with other PJ species such as Pinyon Jay, Common Poorwill, Black-throated Gray Warbler, Black-throated Sparrow, and others.  A few Scott's Orioles can typically be found in the sparser PJ closer to McElmo Canyon.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pinyon/Juniper Forest, Lowland Riparian, Stream</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From the intersection of McElmo Canyon Road (CR G) and US-160/491 just south of Cortez head west on CR G for 20.2 miles to an unmarked and gated road on the right.  Open the gate and head north for 2.4 miles, heading straight over the cattle guard at a junction at 1.5 miles, past a National Monument sign for Cannonball Mesa, well off the road.  Just before the junction at 2.4 miles you will cross a (usually) dry arroyo.  Take a left at 2.4 miles onto an inconspicuous and rough track.  Drive down it as far as you can and walk the rest of the way (about 1.5 miles total; bring water!). When you get towards the end of the road, you'll be getting close to the top of some short rimrock cliffs above the cottonwood gallery.  If you're in the right place, the road should split shortly before the cliff.  Take the right (lower) fork, but watch for a broken-down, unposted fenceline. <b>Do not follow the road through the fenceline--it is the beginning of private property that birders are specifically forbidden from accessing.</b> Instead follow the fenceline to the right, until you reach the top of the short cliff.  Below you you'll see how the road does a hairpin turn and comes back out into public land through the continuation of the fenceline.  Head right (northeast) along the cliff until you find a safe place to descend.  Stay east of the fence.  In 2006, at least one Lucy's territory seemed to stretch along about 100 meters of stream bottom, roughly centered on the fenceline.  Everything down-canyon from here is private property; you can bird upstream from here to about the first side canyon on the right and stay on public land.  <br/><br/>To navigate around this area you will probably want to use the Bowdish Canyon Quadrangle topographic map or the Cortez area BLM map.</p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>For some reason this town seems to be a dove magnet. The first state record of Eurasian Collared-Dove was found just outside of town, the first regular Inca Doves in the state have spent the past few years in the southern part of town, and White-winged Dove occur with increasing regularity. In addition to being a dove Mecca, Rocky Ford sometimes has wintering Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers (look for wells on large conifers. Walking around town and birding the many brushy and well-treed spots may yield surprises (i.e., the Pygmy Nuthatches that spent a winter here). As with most other SE towns, summer residents can include Red-headed and Lewis's Woodpeckers, and Mississippi Kite. Also be sure to check the Valco Pond a mile or two east of town north of US 50 for ducks, geese, and maybe even a swan. The water is visible from the highway. The \"access\" road can be found just west of the gravel piles belonging to Valco, Inc. The lake itself is private and off limits, but can be easily scanned from the access road.<p>The Rocky Ford Sewage Ponds are legendary for waterbirds of every kind, although in recent years they have been allowed to run dry. They are worth a stop on every trip through the area. The wet meadows to the west can have some waterbirds too, including flocks of ibis. Note that there are some ponds to the east of the ones visible from the road, but these eastern ponds are off limits.<p>Though the riparian habitat here is a bit too extensive for this to be a great migrant trap, Rocky Ford State Wildlife Area can be good for some awesome sparrow flocks during the colder months (often with White-throated and Harris's), and other scarce winter species (Carolina and Winter Wrens, Rusty Blackbird). Just because it's not a great migration spot is no reason to neglect it during the spring or fall; you never know what you'll find. This is probably the best spot in the county to find Western Screech-Owl. Rarities that have shown up here include American Woodcock and Red-shouldered Hawk.<p>Unfortunately, the good-sized Dye Reservoir is not really all that scannable. A small part of the lake is viewable from along the road along the canal to the south, and large rafts of ducks are usually frustratingly beyond ID distance.

      "<p>The diverse habitat of this park makes it the best place in Huerfano County to find the widest variety of birds. Martin and Horseshoe Lakes are good-sized bodies of water where Pacific Loons & scoters have been seen. Swans have also been seen here, and one summer a Brown Pelican graced the lakes for several days. Riparian habitat abounds for good passerines. There are two good hikes. A fairly long one (up to 1.5 miles) begins at North Martin Inlet parking area on the north side of this lake. Walk north along the paved trail through dense riparian habitat. Northern Waterthrushes and even an Alder Flycatcher have been seen in this area. At the picnic ground (1/4 mile) with canopy covered tables, take a paved left fork off the main trail to the paved road between Martin & Horseshoe Lakes. Take the road north a short distance to the dam parking area. From here there is a trail south through dense riparian habitat, a cattail pond, and public viewing area at the pond. It's great for both Sora & Virginia Rails, more easily heard than seen. South of the pond the trail gets a little rougher but is still easily walked below Horseshoe Lake Dam. It's a good idea to walk into the riparian area on the left (east) where there is access. Summer Tanagers, American Redstarts, and Black & White Warblers have all been found below the dam. As you approach its south end, there are several trails going left (east) back to the paved road and North Martin Inlet parking area.<p>A shorter walk (about 1/2 mile) starts at the south end of Horseshoe Lake. From the dam parking area at the southeast end of the lake, drive west a short distance to the next parking area with a masonry restroom on the right. A pond (a marsh if dry) is on the left. Check it and then walk a short distance (about 100+ yards) west to the Horseshoe Lake intake ditch. Walk above the east side of the ditch to the lake through excellent riparian habitat. At the lake turn east through more riparian habitat until it's too dense to walk. Climb up the small berm and walk east back to the parking area.

      "<p>Below the dam at Bonny Reservoir is the old Hale townsite. If you want to see the king of all hedgerows, this is where to go. These large rows (perhaps 8-10 in all) can be especially productive in the winter, when (with the appropriate number of people) you are likely to see at least one Long-eared Owl. The past few winters there has been a Barn Owl hanging out here, and there are usually sparrow flocks that can contain Harris' or White-throated Sparrows. These hedgerows can also be good during migration, when anything can show up (well, not a Great Green Macaw). Keep an eye out for Northern Cardinal; this is just about the best area around Bonny to find one. If the hedgerows are hopping, it may be worth your while to head north along the road and bird the trees just past the hedgerows. PLEASE do not trespass on the private property here. <br /><br />North of Hale, just across the river, is the South Republican Wildlife Easement. Rock Wren breeds here, and Sprague's Pipit has been found in fall migration. To look for the pipits, drive through the entrance gate in late September or October and follow the road about a mile to the next gate, which marks the end of public land. Park before going through this second gate and hike up the hill to the right of the road. Walk the ridgeline between the fence and a windmill to the northeast, listening for the characteristic calls of flushed pipits and watching to see where they land. If this fails, keep searching the ridgeline from the windmill east back to the end of the high ground, near the easement entrance. <br /><br />Hale Ponds State Wildlife Area along the South Fork of the Republican River can be good for migrants and some breeding species, but is seldom birded. All of the uncommon breeders listed for Bonny occur here, and some are easier to find. Look for Yellow-billed Cuckoo in summer and Eastern Screech-Owl at any season. <br /><br />South Republican State Wildlife Area is another large wooded area along the South Republican. The same birds that can be seen at Hale Ponds occur here, though the lack of ponds make for fewer waterbirds. Walking the river between here and Hale Ponds is usually dull, but can greatly increase your chances of finding any of the breeding species you still need, or of finding an uncommon sparrow or a Winter Wren during the colder months.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lake/Pond/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Marsh, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Grassland/Prairie, Yucca</p><p><b>Directions:</b> See Bonny Reservoir for directions to the dam. At the south end of the dam CR 2 winds down below the dam to the DOW headquarters and from there east to a T intersection with the north-south CR LL.5. Directly ahead of you, to the east of this intersection, are the Hale hedgerows. To check the other spots, turn left (north). In a short distance, CR 4 heads east; this is the access road for the South Republican SWA, which stretches along the road and the river for several miles, and for Hale Ponds SWA, which is on the left a few miles farther east, just shy of the Kansas border. Much of the wooded area along CR 4 is open to birders; obey posted access signs. Finally, to get to the South Republican Wildlife Easement (Sprague's Pipit spot), continue north on LL.5 from \"Hale\"across the S.

      "<p>This is one of the premier mountain recreation sites in the county, and it is almost always crowded. The road from Ward to Brainard Lake (FR 112) is about four miles long. At about the halfway point is Red Rock Lake. In winter, the road is closed at this point and all further access must be on foot (typically, on foot with snowshoe or ski attached). In summer there is a fee station here. About two miles beyond the fee station the road splits to encircle Brainard Lake and thereafter sends spurs off to two trailheads, the Mitchell Lake and Long Lake trailheads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area around Brainard Lake and its subsidiary trailheads contains the best road-accessible spruce-fir habitat in the county, and the vicinity can be excellent for birds like Gray Jay, Pine Grosbeak and Three-toed Woodpecker. Boreal Owls have been found in this area too, but they are difficult to get. In spring, they usually quit singing by the time the road opens, so finding them requires a potentially dangerous nocturnal snowshoe expedition through avalanche country. Later in the season, the similar-sounding Wilson&amp;#39;s Snipe can confound the search. The best bet is probably to search the area in fall before the snows, playing a tape and hoping for a juvenile bird to come in. Note that the farther up the road, the better the habitat. The area along the road near Red Rock Lake is Limber Pine, not spruce-fir, and therefore not very good for Boreals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the tundra birds in Boulder County and don&amp;#39;t mind a strenuous hike, Audubon Peak is the place to go. You will have to hike a steep mile from the Mitchell Lake trailhead to treeline, but once you get there, you get to spend a long time on the tundra. This is a good hike for ptarmigan (I see them here on about half my trips) and Brown-capped Rosy-Finch. To see the finches, you will need to be high up on the mountain itself--they actually breed behind Audubon on the rocky, snowy Paiute Peak. If you don&amp;#39;t see them on Audubon, head over towards Paiute from the peak, exercising extreme caution on the rocks. The traverse to Paiute requires real mountaineering skill, but with luck you should be able to get close enough to find some finches without having to do any actual scrambling. Keep in mind that the long distance above treeline is both a blessing and a curse. If bad weather sneaks up on you from the other side of the Continental Divide, you will have no place to hide. Keep a very close eye on the sky, and come prepared for a serious hike of a 13,000 foot peak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may prefer to hike to Lake Isabelle or Blue Lake, at the base of these mountains where the tundra begins. Ptarmigan are possible here, but unreliable. But pipits abound, and Rosy-Finches can sometimes be seen, especially where snow persists in cliffy areas. Be very careful up there.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Spruce-Fir Forest, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Streamside Willow, Krummholz, Alpine Tundra, Cliff Face</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From Boulder, take Canyon Boulevard (CO 119) west from town to Nederland.

      "<p>(submitted by Andrew Spencer): This site is famous (or infamous, depending on whom you ask!) for being the only place in the state where Ruffed Grouse can be found. To say access is hard is an almost unforgivable understatement. The only way to access this area without crossing private property is to hike in from the north. Budget at least a day to reach the site, a day to look for the bird, and another day to hike out. Accessing this site in this manner is definitely not for the faint of heart, but makes for a truly unforgettable adventure.<p>To reach the site from the north, hike down the trail at the bottom of Hoy Draw, over the Diamond Mountain Ridge to Davis Draw, and then when near the head of Davis Draw hike straight west through BLM land to the eastern flank of Hoy Mountain. A good map of the area (preferable the USGS section maps, and an atlas that shows land ownership boundaries) would be necessary to get this route to work.<p>Once on the eastern flank of Hoy Mountain there are two places to look for the bird. When viewed from the east, the peak of Hoy Mountain appears to be in the middle of the ridge. The spot where the bird has been seen most recently is a large grove of aspen just to the south of the peak, above a band of rimrock visible from the east. To reach the spot, hike up just to the north of the first major drainage south of the peak.<p>The other spot to check is north of the peak. To reach it, walk up the rough track due east of the peak to its end, and then beyond it to the large aspen grove, which should be visible at that point.<p>Actually finding the birds can take a great deal of effort, even after you have reached the groves. The best bet is to cover the suitable habitat (aspen mixed with conifers, with a dense undergrowth) thoroughly, and this is best done with a good-sized group. You will almost certainly see lots of Dusky Grouse, and other species typical of pinyon-juniper and aspen woodland.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Aspen Grove, Pinyon-Juniper Forest, Mixed-Conifer Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To reach Hoy Draw, from Brown's Park, cross the Swinging Bridge and take a left at the \"T\".

When water levels are low it can be excellent for shorebirds; when they are higher, for dabbling and diving ducks. Gulls, waders, cormorants, and other waterbirds are a good bet. During migration, swallows occasionally gather in enormous flocks over the water.&lt;p&gt;The marshy part of Cottonwood Marsh is traversed by a boardwalk just west of the Walden Ponds parking lot. Virginia Rail, Sora, and Wilson&amp;#39;s Snipe breed here, and it can be a good spot for wintering sparrows possibly including a White-throated, Harris&amp;#39;s or Swamp.&lt;p&gt;The numerous paths around the Walden/Sawhill complex provide access to a large number of ponds, each with its own water level and vegetative structure. Most of the regular waterbirds can be found here in season, though shorebird habitat outside Cottonwood Marsh is often limited. American Bittern is probably a regular summer resident, moving between the larger reedbeds, but it can be difficult to see or hear. Dawn and dusk may be your best bet, as with the Black-crowned Night-Herons that are more numerous and easier to see. The brush and trees around the ponds will produce all the typical birds of lowland woodland edge habitats, including some locally uncommon species like Eastern Kingbird and occasionally Orchard Oriole. Foothill birds like Rock Wren and Green-tailed Towhee can be common in migration.&lt;p&gt;The western edge of the main footpath loop gets close to the mature forests along the creek, skirting the best habitat for migrant and breeding landbirds.

It can have good numbers of birds, mostly of the citified variety, but goodies have shown up and the place may be worth checking for migrant landbirds and wintering waterfowl. Just across Hover Road to the east are the Boulder County Fairgrounds, which have a couple of ponds of their own, as well as some breeding Osprey. <br /><br />The central parts of the greenway are pretty urban, but the city has extended the trail east of Main Street almost to the Longmont Sewage Treatment Plant. This has opened up some very nice riverside birding areas that were formerly closed. Unfortunately, the quality of some of the habitats has been diminished by the clearing of brush and the introduction of prairie-dogs. Furthermore, the best area of the creek, just south of the Sewage Treatment Plant, is out-of-bounds.

The lake rarely if ever freezes over completely so winter geese and ducks can be good. Greater White-fronted and Snow Geese and a few good gulls make at least a brief appearance most years. Bald Eagles can be regular in January and February. Cottonwoods, willows, and cattails border the lake on the north and west. Swamp Sparrow and Winter Wren have been found in fall. Bullock's Orioles and Yellow Warbler are breeders. There is fairly good potential for migrants, which have included Rose-breasted Grosbeak and Blackpoll Warbler. <br /><br />The Greenlee Natural Area adjoins the city park on the northwest corner.

      "<p>This neglected SWA is among the crown jewels of northeastern Colorado, at least when it comes to quality and quantity of habitat. It has not been visited nearly enough to quantify its quality in terms of birds, however. Consider this a call to action. <br /><br />The southeast part of the SWA contains a large and awe-inspiring grove of trees with thick underbrush that is just begging for a great migrant flock. This grove also has a small Great Blue Heron rookery among some of the taller trees, so please be careful not to disturb the nesting birds. This grove is visible about a quarter mile to the west of the SE parking lot. <br /><br />South of this grove there is a small creek lined with dense tamarisk, willow, and Russian olive. More Russian-olive groves can be found to the south of the creek. This part of the SWA is reminiscent of portions of Prewitt SWA that have produced many a good migrant in the past. North of the creek and southwest of the big grove mentioned above is a large cattail marsh that has Virginia Rail and should have Sora, American Bittern, and Marsh Wren as well. To get to this part of the SWA, head west on the north side of the creek from the SE parking lot. <br /><br />There are many juniper hedgerows running throughout the property, mostly between the north edge and the east-west canal (not to be confused with the aforementioned creek, which is farther south). Access to these hedgerows is best from the north-central parking lot, halfway along CR 64 on the northern border of the property. Look in the junipers for migrants, sparrow flocks in the winter, and possibly Long-eared and Saw-whet Owls during the colder months. <br /><br />Both the western and northern edges of the property have more dense hedgerows that parallel the road and are definitely worth a look for migrants and sparrows. Be careful of the property boundaries here, especially along the western edge, where there is some private land along the road. The parking lot at the northeast corner of the SWA provides access to still more hedgerows and Russian-olive thickets, and there is a large prairie dog town just east of it that should contain Burrowing Owls. <br /><br />Just west of the NW corner of the SWA, on the south side of CR 64, there is a small private pond and some good marshes along the south side of the road where one should look for ducks, rails, Yellow-headed Blackbird and Marsh Wren.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Marsh, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To reach this SWA, take exit 149 off of I-76 (the Crook exit), and travel north from the exit ramp to US-138.

      "<p>Blue Lake, also known as Adobe Creek Reservoir, is one of the most underbirded locations in SE Colorado. Water levels vary from chock full to so low that there are actually two lakes, one in Bent County and one in Kiowa. A visit here at any time of the year could be productive, with the migration periods usually the peak time. In the summer, this is one of the few locations in the state that has a breeding population of Piping Plovers and Least Terns; however, PLEASE do not disturb any nesting areas of these state endangered species. Starting in July Blue Lake becomes a true shorebird Mecca. Practically every species that has occurred in the state has been seen here, mostly on the southern portion of the lake in Bent County. This seems to be a good locale for American Golden-Plover. <br /><br />While not as famed for waterbird activity, the lake usually produces a good mix of species, especially later in the fall. Loons and gulls should be looked for in the late fall and early winter, before the lake freezes. The wintertime is generally not as productive as other times of the year, but the roads around Blue Lake are among the best areas in the state to find wintering prairie longspurs. <br /><br />Blue Lake is also not well known as a good spring migration spot, but don't let this deter you from visiting. Though the water is often higher, there still may be mudflats for shorebirds, and gulls and ducks still occur. This area is also not well known as a land bird location, but a check of the tamarisk around the lake may produce surprises.

This pond is good for waterfowl in migration and frequently stays open in winter. White-winged Scoter was once seen here in fall. <br /><br />Lake Beckwith Recreation area is good for waterfowl in migration & in winter when not frozen. Below the dam is some of the best passerine habitat in the Greenhorn Valley. Loons & Scoters have been seen on the lake in fall, and a Blackburnian Warbler was recorded below the dam in October. A Mourning Warbler was seen in August, 2000. <br /><br />Greenhorn Meadows Park is bisected by Greenhorn Creek. It provides excellent riparian habitat which is good for passerines any time of year but especially in migration. Best vagrants include Blackburnian and Magnolia Warblers. The Park is noteworthy for its wrens. Winter Wrens have been regularly present here October through March. The steep canyon at the west end of the park harbored a Carolina Wren one winter. <br /><br />\"The Frog Pond,\" so called by local birders, has also been a migrant mecca for many years and is located at the west end of Terlesa Ave. Terlesa can be reached from the jct. of CSH 165 and Stanley about 5-6 miles west of I-25. Stanley winds southwest to Terlesa. The pond can be seen north of Terlesa. Many a rare passerine has shown here, especially in migration. Best birds have included White-eyed Vireo, Hooded and Kentucky Warblers, and Red Fox Sparrow. <br /><br />Rye Mountain Park at the west end of town consists mainly of Ponderosa Pine and Scrub Oak habitats. Ovenbirds have traditionally nested here for years but human pressures along with their pets plus recent tree thinning operations may have extirpated these birds. They should still be watched and listened for in late spring and summer. The Park is an easy place to find Dusky and Cordilleran Flycatchers. The willow riparian area along Greenhorn Creek near the Pavilion has nesting MacGillivray's Warblers. Though rare migrants are usually absent, a Black-throated Blue Warbler was recorded in the park in fall. <br /><br />Hiking Trails near Rye: Greenhorn Trail is located at the west end of Cuerna Verde Road. This trail climbs into the Greenhorn Wilderness area (3 miles) and eventually to Greenhorn Peak (9 miles). It has Ponderosa and scrub oak at lower elevations, spruce, fir, and aspen at higher elevations. Dusky Grouse & Three-toed Woodpeckers are regularly found in the Wilderness area, often 3-6 miles from the trailhead. The trail eventually climbs above timberline, but no Ptarmigan have been recently found in this area. <br /><br />Millset Trail is located about 5 miles west of Rye on CSH 165. The trailhead is well marked by a USFS sign just past the National Forest Boundary. It climbs mostly through spruce, fir, & aspen habitat, but there is much ponderosa and scrub oak at lower elevations of the trail. This trail is good for woodpeckers. Red-naped Sapsuckers are often found within 2 miles of the trailhead. Three-toed Woodpeckers are regularly seen 4-5 miles from the trailhead. Hammond's Flycatchers have also been regularly found on this trail. Pine Grosbeaks are irregular. About a mile from the trailhead there is a radio tower. The trail forks here.

In Moffat County, high elevation montane species such as Pine Grosbeak, Gray Jay, Three-toed Woodpecker and Golden-crowned Kinglet are found almost exclusively on Black Mountain. Red Crossbill, Dusky Grouse and other montane species, while not limited exclusively in Moffat County to Black Mountain, are probably most easily found here.

You are sure to see Eurasian Collared-Doves and Chimney Swifts in the summer, and you never know what else you may find. Don't neglect the large town park in the SE quadrant of the town. <br /><br />Just south of town, across I-70, is the Flagler Golf Course. The ponds here often have a few ducks on them, and maybe a Yellow-headed Blackbird in the surrounding cattails. You can scan the ponds from a parking lot outside the entrance to the golf course, along the county road. The small area of junipers around the parking lot could contain a few birds as well. Look for swallows above the water. <br /><br />East of Flagler and north of I-70, on the road to the SWA, is Flagler Cemetery. The habitat here is marginal, but if you are desperate for migrants it may be worth a check. <br /><br />Out to the north and east of Flagler, on CR V (the next mile road north of the road to the SWA), there is a small farmer's pond on the south side of the road. It is ringed by thin cattails and may have some ducks. While it is no better than the golf course ponds, it is certainly no worse.

      "<p>The largest town and county seat of Kit Carson County generally receives less birding attention than Flagler, but can serve up equally good birds. In the town itself, Eurasian Collared-Doves and Great-tailed Grackles abound, and seeing a Chimney Swift during the summer is not unusual. Keep an eye out for Mississippi Kites, which are colonizing NE Colorado and will surely appear here in the near future. <br /><br />As in all towns of size on the eastern plains, the abundant trees around town can be worth a look for migrants in season. When looking for migrants, be sure to check the amazingly thick but young grove of trees on the southeast corner of Rose and 8th, just west of exit 438. While nothing of consequence has been found here yet, that is almost certainly due to lack of coverage. <br /><br />Unlike the previous location, things of consequence have been found at the Burlington Cemetery, just north of town along US-385. The cemetery is mostly made up of large conifers with no undergrowth, and thus is mostly good for treetop migrants and not as good for skulkers. This location can also be good for sparrows during migration. Look for warbler flocks in season, and sapsuckers during the winter. During certain years this can be a spot to check for mountain invaders such as Red Crossbill and Mountain Chickadee. A Cape May Warbler that was found here one spring demonstrates this spot's potential. <br /><br />The Burlington Sewage Ponds, just south of town, are often the best spot in the county for waterbirds. These ponds can be teeming with ducks, a few grebes, swallows, etcetera. Generally, these ponds do not have good mud-flats, but Wilson's Phalaropes can abound, and Red-necked should be looked for. Unlike many sewage ponds on the eastern plains, these are easily scanned from the road.

      "<p>(Submitted by Mike Henwood) Lakewood's BCLP ($4 daily fee or annual pass) includes numerous trails along wooded riparian habitat (Bear Creek and Turkey Creek), across flat short grass prairie dotted with prairie dog colonies, among hilly short grass prairie interspersed with wetland drainages, and a trail around Bear Creek Reservoir (144 surface acres). A multiple use Trail Map and a Bird Checklist (over 150 species) are available at the entrance or at the Park Visitor Center. <br /><br />Spring/Fall Migration – Park in the southeast corner of the parking lot above Pelican Point. Walk the east and north side of the parking lot to the pavilion and beginning of the Fitness Trail. Bird the trees and bushes around this area and then take the Cottonwood Trail around the lake and west along Bear Creek to the end of the Fitness Trail, where you can make a circle and take the Fitness Trail back to #1 and your starting point. During migration periods you can turn up several new songbird species daily. Some of the more unusual sightings have been Bobolink, Eastern Phoebe, Cassin's and Clay-colored Sparrows, and MacGillivray's, Nashville, and Worm-eating Warblers. This loop will turn up interesting breeding birds in late May/early June such as Lazuli Bunting, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Gray Catbird and Yellow-breasted Chat. The area south of the parking lot and north of Turkey Creek can also be productive. <br /><br />Bear Creek Reservoir – Bird from Pelican Point, paying close attention to the inlets and coves along the west side of the lake. Some of the more interesting water birds have included an Ancient Murrelet, Horned Grebe, Barrow's Goldeneye, White-faced Ibis, and White Pelicans. The Reservoir can also be birded by parking at Mountain View and walking along the paved path on the east side. This is advisable in winter when much of the lake is frozen. There is usually a good variety of ducks in the spring and fall, and Black-crowned Night Herons are possible breeders in the area. <br /><br />Bear Creek and Turkey Creek riparian woodlands – There are trails along both sides of Bear Creek and Turkey Creek which provide good birding any time of year. The park supports 3-4 pairs of Great Horned Owls and several pairs of Red-tailed Hawks which nest along the drainages as well as Kestrels and in some years Cooper's Hawks. A pair of Swainson's Hawks nested in the park in 2004. <br /><br />Mountain View and Coyote Gulch – These open grassland areas provide good birding for open country migrants such as falcons, bluebirds, kingbirds, shrikes, Sage Thrashers, Say's Phoebe, and sparrows in March/April and August/early Sept. Check the light pole at the end of the road adjacent to the Fox Hollow Golf Course for Peregrine and Prairie Falcons as well as Kestrels. The marsh up Coyote Gulch has both Virginia and Sora rails. Soras wintered there during the winter of 2004-05. <br /><br />Auto Loop and Bad Weather Birding – Driving the roads can be a productive way to bird the park after a snowstorm. Many of the birds will be close to the edge of the plowed roadway after a snowstorm. Spring snowstorms will especially yield some early migrants such as Mountain and Western Bluebirds, Shrikes and Say's Phoebe.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Grassland/Prairie, Marsh</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From C-470 and Morrison Road (CO 8), go east on Morrison Road approximately 0.25 miles to the Bear Creek Lake Park entrance. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>Ah, the legendary Cameron Pass!--site of many a frigid midnight stroll, tape player in one hand, flashlight in the other, in search of the mythical Boreal Owl. We cannot possibly overstate the amount of luck required even to hear, much less see, this sought-after bird. Those who have returned with stories of amazing close-up encounters are to be mistrusted; if your experience is like theirs, we shall be very angry with you. However, if you do wish to try your luck, the following advice is in order. First, be prepared to begin well after dusk and finish long before dawn, as Boreals are true middle-of-the-night owls. Second, tapes are of very limited use in spring (March-early May), when birds are unlikely to respond. Instead, drive the road, stopping every quarter mile and listening carefully for five to ten minutes, as the birds will often wait long periods between calls. Tapes DO seem to be helpful in late summer and fall, when owls will respond to them with a loud, sharply downslurred &amp;quot;skiew&amp;quot; call and sometimes a close approach. The questions of clear skies vs. cloudy and new moon vs. full do not seem to be terribly important, but a calm night is essential if you are to have any hope of hearing the birds, or of them hearing you.

      "<p>This was the site of the Walker Ranch Fire in 2000, which burned much of the park. Three-toed Woodpeckers have taken up residence in the resulting burn, but they can be very difficult to find, and both Hairy and Downy Woodpeckers are far more common. In some years, winter trips to the burn have also produced Bohemian Waxwing, White-winged Crossbill, Northern Pygmy-Owl and Eastern Bluebird, though none of these is to be expected. More likely are mixed flocks of chickadees, nuthatches, kinglets, creepers, juncos, robins and solitaires. Any of Colorado's regular raptors might fly over.<p>The upper parts of the Meyers Homestead trail, starting about a mile from the parking lot, have been productive on recent spring and early summer nights for Common Poorwill and Flammulated Owl. The poorwills are rather common and may be almost anywhere in the area, but typically call mostly during a brief period right around dusk, and only sporadically thereafter. The Flammulated Owls are on the steep wooded hillside across the stream from the trail, starting about a mile from the parking lot and continuing until the trail bends away from the stream, about a mile later. Unfortunately, water and airplane noise can make owling difficult, and the owls are silent some nights even in peak season. Northern Saw-whet and Northern Pygmy-Owls are a possibility along this trail as well, as is Dusky Grouse during the day.<p>Just down the road from the Walker Ranch trailheads, and contiguous with part of the burn, is the Gross Reservoir State Wildlife Area.

      "<p>(Contributed by Andrew Spencer and Henry Armknecht): Most people call it Jumbo, but on some maps and signs, it is labeled as Julesburg Reservoir. Whether or not you think the reservoir deserves the name \"Jumbo\", the birding here certainly does! Jumbo is filled by canal in the winter and drawn down for irrigation during the summer, so water levels can vary widely. The reservoir may be almost dry by late fall. Jumbo can provide great fall shorebird activity due to the drawdown and wide mudflats. Access to Jumbo requires a fee--daily permits are available at self-pay stations for $3.00. If you have a hunting or fishing license, you may purchase an annual permit for $5.00. The reservoir straddles the county line; the western portion of it is in Logan County, the eastern portion in Sedgwick County. <br /><br />A road entirely circles Jumbo, but actually seeing all the shorebirds from it can be really tough, and requires scanning from all possible viewpoints. The best places to check are usually 1) the southwest corner along CR 68 just east of CR 95 (Logan), 2) the former campground just south of the dam (Sedgwick), 3) the area around the outlet canal along the dam (Sedgwick), 4) the promontory just north of the dam (Sedgwick), and 5) a couple of vantage points along the NW side that require a bit of a walk (Logan). Just about every shorebird that has occurred in Colorado has been seen here, and Jumbo is especially noted as a good place to find Buff-breasted Sandpipers, which when present are usually in the emergent vegetation in the southwest corner. <br /><br />Many thousands of Snow and Ross's Geese use the lake in the spring, and throughout the winter if there is open water. Greater White-fronted Goose is not uncommon. This remote lake should be studied carefully for rare visitors--any place that has attracted a Ross's Gull (as Jumbo did in 1983) deserves a lot of respect! Jumbo is also a particularly reliable spot for Sabine's Gull in the fall; a trip here often produces multiple individuals. Even some good waders can show up, as three Yellow-crowned Night-Herons demonstrated in 2002. <br /><br />The timbered area that is a former campground on the southeast side of Jumbo is a good bet for migrating warblers, vireos, etc. Eastern Screech-Owl and Great Horned Owl are resident. While you're landbirding, don't neglect the groves on the west side (some of which are on private property, some of which are not--use good judgment to tell the difference). <br /><br />Other places to check here include the marshes below the road on the southern part of the reservoir for Yellow-headed Blackbird, rails, and maybe a Marsh Wren. The prairie dog towns northeast and southeast of the lake can be good for raptors, including Golden Eagle and Ferruginous Hawk, especially during the winter, and Burrowing Owl in summer. On the north and southeast sides of the lake there are some high quality grasslands that can have breeding Grasshopper Sparrow, Upland Sandpiper and Dickcissel. Finally, the very long hedgerow to the south of the lake (in Sedgwick County) often has Long-eared Owls roosting in it during the winter, though given how long the row is, finding them can be quite hard.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Shortgrass Prairie, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Marsh</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Jumbo is located about a mile north of CO 138 on the Logan/Sedgwick County line, five miles west of the town of Sedgwick.

      "<p>The town itself, four miles west of Kansas, has great potential for migrants. You might want to start at Gateway Park, which stretches north from US 50 for several blocks, with mature deciduous shade trees the whole way. Another spot to check is the Holly cemetery northeast of town, which has a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees and is a little more isolated. <br /><br />Just west of town along US 50 are a couple of wet spots which can have ducks and possibly shorebirds in season. One is on the north side of 50, two miles west of town, between CR 32 and CR 33. The other is on the south side of 50, just east of the bridge across the Arkansas River, five miles west of town. <br /><br />Don't miss the rest area three miles east of town, which has a nice combination of trees and brush. It could produce absolutely anything, but is drastically underbirded. <br /><br />South of the rest area, where the Arkansas River crosses the state line, is the remote Arkansas River State Wildlife Area (also known as the Hammit State Wildlife Area). The DOW has marked this SWA for decommission, but as of this writing it persists. The riparian habitat here is pretty marginal, but look for Yellow-breasted Chat and Bobwhite and, if you are very lucky, Eastern Meadowlark. <br /><br />Another area worth checking is the spot where CO 89 crosses the Arkansas River just south of town, and the areas to the east on the south side of the river. A small population of Lesser Prairie-chicken may persist near here, but the chances of seeing one are slim. Eastern Meadowlarks have also been reported from this area (as was the first state record of Pyrrhuloxia!), so keep eyes and ears open.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Park/Cemetery, Lowland Riparian, Stream, Grassland/Prairie, Pond/Lake/Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Holly is along US 50 four miles west of the Kansas border.

      "<p>Birds that can be seen in Dolores County's largest town include Rock Pigeon (a rarity in Dolores County--check the silos); Eurasian Collared-Dove (check large trees around town, especially along Dove Street); four species of hummingbirds in migration, with Black-chinned Hummingbird breeding; and migrant landbirds in season. Cooper's Hawk has nested in town, and Say's Phoebe can usually be seen along the main road in the east part of town. Dove Creek has a single but fairly large sewage pond, at the north end of College, where there is a large dirt pullout on the east side of the road. To view the pond, either stand on your car, on the base of the water tower, or on the large piece of concrete in the pullout area. Though it doesn't look like much, in duck-starved Dolores County this is a must hit spot for any lister. <br /><br />There are also two tiny wet areas on private land near Dove Creek, one just west of town on CR J (difficult to view from the road), and one south of town along US 491 (formerly US 666) at Alkali Draw near Cahone. As water is rare in western Dolores County, these spots are worth checking out, but you must bird from the road. Alkali Draw is particularly good, having produced Sora and breeding Black Phoebe.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Lowland Riparian, Pond/Lake/Reservoir</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Dove Creek is along the newly renamed Highway 491 between Cortez, CO and Monticello, UT.

      "<p>For some reason the county roads east of Antonito are particularly good for raptors, including Ferruginous and Rough-legged Hawks, at least in fall/winter. The roadside vegetation can be birdy as well; you might find breeding Southwest Willow Flycatchers in the willows. <br /><br />Antonito itself has Eurasian Collared-Doves, but then so do all the towns in the San Luis Valley. More interesting for birding are Conejos and Guadalupe, two tiny hamlets just northwest of Antonito. Tiny Conejos hosts not only the county seat but also Colorado's oldest church, a sight worth seeing by itself. When you're ready to look at birds, explore the great willow and riparian habitat along the road between Conejos and Guadalupe (private property; remain on the road). The road heading southwest out of Conejos runs past some marshes and wet fields with breeding blackbirds, rails, etcetera. <br /><br />There are a few ponds north of Antonito worth checking for ducks, swallows etcetera. One cluster of ponds is on the west side of US 285 just north of CR L, about 4 miles north of town. There is another pond on the west side of 285 four miles farther north, at the junction with CR R. The last pond in the area is a square holding pond 2.5 miles west of the previous pond on the south side of CR R.

      "<p>There are no sidewalks and very few trails in Pueblo West so car birding is the rule. Pueblo West's sprawl has created an interesting birding opportunity. The population of Scaled Quail has boomed along with development. Driving the roads of Pueblo West gives you a better chance of finding the quail and Curve-billed Thrasher than at Pueblo Reservoir. There are two main roads into Pueblo West off Hwy 50: Purcell Boulevard (on the eastern edge of town) and McCulloch Boulevard (the main entrance). Purcell Boulevard leads to Liberty Point, an area with a view, cliffs and pinyon juniper amongst nice homes. The main entrance at McCulloch Boulevard leads to the golf course and the Pueblo West Inn. There is a pond near the Inn that is good for interesting waterfowl in winter if the water is open. A good chance of finding Scaled Quail and the thrasher is near the golf course and on Harmony Drive east off McCulloch. <br /><br />There are numerous Prairie Dog colonies in Pueblo West and chances of spotting a Burrowing Owl are good until the colonies disappear with human infill. One particularly productive place is at the intersection of McCulloch and Nichols (the Pueblo West entrance to Pueblo Reservoir). <br /><br />On the western edge of Pueblo West is the Turkey Creek drainage. This can be good for birding and is where the first Say's Phoebe was discovered to science in 1820. The Turkey Creek State Wildlife Area is on the southwest edge of Pueblo West and is accessible only from Pueblo West. The weedy areas have lots of sparrows and the quail are there too. Here you can get out and walk a little. <br /><br />Any road in Pueblo West on the north or south side of Hwy 50 can lead through shortgrass prairie, cholla, rabbitbrush, sage and pinyon juniper habitat.

On the north side of the park are a couple of groves worth birding. One is the fenced Wildlife Preserve around Kestrel Pond in the northwest corner of the property, which is closed to protect nesting birds from March to June. During the closure, the only access to this area is during guided nature walks scheduled by Jefferson County Open Space. Several blocks east of here is a shelterbelt of mature cottonwoods and underbrush, best accessed from a small roadside pullout on the south side of 32nd Avenue near Estes. This shelterbelt should be checked in spring and fall for migrant landbirds.<p>East of the park and the lake is the massive Crown Hill Cemetery. Bird the evergreens in winter hoping for irruptive species like crossbills, Carduelis finches, Evening and Pine Grosbeaks, and Bohemian Waxwing. Warblers may come through in spring and fall.<p>Another cemetery to check when you are in the area is the Arvada Cemetery about two miles north. Smaller, more secluded and (ironically) much \"hillier\" than Crown Hill, the Arvada Cemetery has an okay number of evergreens of varying sizes.<p>If waterbirds are your goal, a side trip to the medium-sized, steep-sided Maple Grove Reservoir may be of minor interest. 26th Street west of Crown Hill Lake will take you over the Maple Grove dam in 1.5 miles.

If you go north from Hayden on the only road out of town that crosses the Yampa River, within a mile of town you will reach a T intersection. Turn right. In another two or three miles the road splits and you should follow Route 80 left and uphill. From this intersection over the crest of the hill is a scrub-oak habitat that has Dusky Grouse. When you reach the top of the hill, look beyond (north of) the fenceline that runs along the ridge for a signed parcel of public land. This is your best shot at seeing a displaying male Dusky Grouse, but they could be anywhere in or around the oaks. All the other land along this road is private and can only be birded from the road. A few miles past the fenceline (four miles from the intersection of CR 80 and CR 70), 200 yards from the road on the left, is a Greater Sage-Grouse lek on private land. Sharp-tailed Grouse used to display in this area, but they have abandoned the Route 80 lek, possibly due to excessive disturbance.<p>After viewing the Sage-Grouse, to see a Sharp-tailed Grouse, high-tail it (no pun intended) the four miles back to the intersection of CR 80 x CR 70 and turn left (east) onto CR 70. When the road hits US 40 in about five miles, take a right (west). In 1.5 miles, turn left (south) onto CR 27 (Twenty Mile Road). Go south for five miles and park in a pullout on the left.

Be very careful of traffic and placement of vehicles. The traffic has picked up on CR 27 to the point where inattentive drivers can get in trouble.<p>All off-road areas are private, and leks are highly sensitive to disturbances.

The town sits at the foot of a hundred-foot cliff, known affectionately (by some at least) as the Kremmlin' Wall. The Wall often attracts roosting flocks of Rosy-Finches in winter; birders with a good scope and some patience should be able to get (barely) identifiable views of all three species from the dead-end roads near the school. Sometimes the birds descend en masse to feeders in town, but their food forays are unpredictable. Keep an eye out for Common Redpoll, which has visited feeders here a few times in winters past. <br /><br /> If the finches are on the wall, but too distant for your liking, you can attempt to access the top of the cliff via a dirt road (CR 227) running east from Highway 40 just north and west of town. This road is not maintained in winter and may require four-wheel-drive, snow tires or chains depending on conditions. It is easy to get stuck up there, so please exercise caution. <br /><br /> Check the tiny sewage ponds on the south side of town along Highway 9 for Cinnamon Teal and other dabblers in summer. More ducks can be found at the oxbow pond just south of Spruce & Eagle in the southwest corner of town. <br /><br /> On the other side of the Colorado River, just southeast of town, Road 33 heads east through Junction Butte SWA on its way to Williams Fork Reservoir. The seasonally flooded fields below the road have good potential for the likes of snipe, Sandhill Crane, and various waterfowl and shorebirds. Great-tailed Grackle and Marsh Wren have bred in this area. <br /><br /> Just south of Rd 33, Trough Road (CR 1) heads west from the highway towards the Radium area.

Check this area for migrants as well as for northeast specialty breeders such as Bell's Vireo, Baltimore Oriole, Red-bellied Woodpecker, etc. There is also a small lake here. More ponds can be seen to the south of the Highway 6 bridge over the South Platte River. <br /><br />The Museum Park, on the south side of US-6 just west of the river and east of the railroad crossing, contains some small evergreens that could potentially contain an owl or some interesting migrant/winter wanderer. Columbine Park, at South 3rd Avenue and Delmar, has some trees that can be decent in migration, and in recent summers it has become the only known nesting location along I-76 for Mississippi Kite. However, the best birding spot in town is Pioneer Park, just west of town on SR 14 and CR 37, which has a nice open woodland with a variety of different tree sizes, all made beautifully accessible by a system of gravel trails. A canal with underbrush increases the place's attraction to birds. This spot is begging for a rarity, and Eastern Screech-Owl is resident. The other spot not to miss is the Sterling Cemetery, south of town along US 6, which has also had Eastern Screech-Owl, as well as sparrows including White-throated and Harris's. The cemetery has produced some decent migrating flocks in the past. <br /><br />    Sterling wastewater treatment plant: From US 6 just west of I-76, take CR 370 to the north for about 4.5 miles to visit these ponds in the winter as they offer a resting place for ducks using open spots in the South Platte River.

      "<p>Andrick Ponds State Wildlife Area is a vastly underbirded location with an abundance of ponds and marshes plus small cottonwood and juniper groves. It&amp;nbsp;lies just southwest of Jackson Lake State Park (do not be confused by the fact that Jackson Lake State Park is mislocated on many maps, such as eBird and Google Maps). It lies south of Morgan County Road AA and between Morgan County Roads 2 and 3. Most birders bird this location from its edges by driving the above mentioned roads, and indeed, many of the better marshes can be viewed from these public roads. Entering the state wildlife area itself, for non-hunters, is usually limited to a parking lot on west side of Morgan County Road 3 just north of the Inlet Channel and across the street from the private trailer park on the east side of county road 3. A stroll through Andrick from this access would entail a goodly 2-3 miles, but may well be worth it during non-hunting season. Check the state wildlife area website for current rules and regulations.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Since Andrick has been underbirded, exactly what its potential may be is unknown. A Mottled Duck spent several days off of county road 2 during July 2013. Least Bittern has been found here on at least two occasions and may breed, at least intermittently. American Bitterns are to be expected if the area is walked, with up to seven having been found in an hour&#39;s effort. The ponds can have fair numbers of shorebirds and herons (including Glossy Ibis in 2013) depending on water levels.

      "<p>An irrigation water storage reservoir, this oasis in the desert between Grand Junction and Delta at the western base of the Grand Mesa attracts a wide array of waterfowl, shorebirds, and other water-loving birds, particularly during spring and fall migration. The surrounding desert of saltbush-greasewood and low hills hide the reservoir from view until you get there. The wash below the dam has some mature cottonwoods, and the lakeshore has scattered patches of willow and, unfortunately, tamarisk. Birds you could see here are Gambel's Quail, Yellow Warbler, Bullock's Oriole, Greater Sandhill Crane, most any duck known to migrate through western Colorado valleys, herons, egrets, grebes, ibises, sandpipers, yellowlegs, curlews, snipe, etc. <br /><br />The road from US 50 can become nearly impassable when wet, even with 4-wheel drive. The shale-derived soils in the area can be pretty greasy, but since this area, often referred to locally as \"the stinking desert\" really is a desert, greasy is a somewhat rare condition. A convenience store with gasoline at Whitewater can provide you with the basics; beyond that, Grand Junction and Delta are your best bets for lodging and dining. The Cheney Reservoir turnoff from US 50 is perhaps a mile or two closer to Grand Junction than Delta.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Reservoir, Sagebrush, Lowland Riparian, Tamarisk</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From the junction of US 50 and CO 141 just south of Whitewater (10 miles SE of Grand Junction on US 50), proceed 9.75 miles southeast on US 50. Look for an unmarked BLM dirt road/gate in the fence on the left (east) side of highway at milepost 51. Turn left (east, toward the Grand Mesa) and go 1.5 miles to Cheney Reservoir. The primary dam and lands downstream private; most of the rest of the shoreline is on BLM land. The main access road passes through private land and this notice does not give the public permission to enter; please respect private property. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>Combined, these four medium sized reservoirs in southern Lakewood provide the perfect mix of habitats for an urban birding spot. However, they rarely receive birding attention, and their true potential is unknown. If you are in the area birding Belmar Park or Marston Reservoir, a short side-trip to these ponds could be well worth your while. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The namesake lake here is Kendrick Reservoir, the southeasternmost one. Check the water for ducks and the trees, especially in the southwest corner, for migrants. The real draw here, however, is the large marsh that rings the lake, most thickly at the western end where a boardwalk runs through it. Rails, Marsh Wren, and maybe even a bittern are possible here. During migration and winter, this would be a good spot to look for Swamp Sparrow as well as other species. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The neighboring lake to the west is Smith Reservoir, the largest lake of the group, but possibly the least productive for ducks. However, this lake boasts one of the best riparian groves in the area, especially on the north and west sides. This place is just begging for some rarities. The easiest way to check the grove is to walk the trail on the north side, and to walk along Moore Street along the west edge up to the apartment complex. Smith Reservoir also seems to have the best shore when low, so be sure to keep an eye out for shorebirds. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The two other lakes in the complex are to the north. East Reservoir is probably the best lake for ducks, and large rafts of divers and dabblers are possible here. This lake is very reminiscent of Little Gaynor Lake in Boulder County. There are some small marshes ringing the water, but no trees of any kind. Scan from Arkansas Avenue on the south. Just to the west is Main Reservoir, where you can find riparian groves that are even better than those at Smith Reservoir. Look here for migrants in season and sparrows during the winter. The lake itself can be good for ducks as well as American White Pelican and abundant cormorants on the sticks in the middle of the water. A good trail goes around the entirety of the lake, providing access to all the good trees, most of which are on the south and west sides. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Nearby Addenbrook Park is barely worth mentioning. It contains some small, sparse trees and a little pond.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lake, Lowland Riparian, Urban/Suburban</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To reach Kendrick Reservoir, take Jewell Ave west from Wadsworth to the entrance of the park, on the right in a little less than a mile. By driving a little further west along Jewell Ave you can find pullouts in parking lots that let you scan the west end of the lake, or access the boardwalk. Smith Reservoir is reached by going a little further along Jewell Ave to Moore Ct, and taking a right. You can scan some of the lake from here, and bird the thick brush and trees till you get to the apartment complex. The north end to the lake can be reached by taking Jewell to Kipling and turning north to Florida Ave, in about a half mile and taking a right (east). The entrance to the north end of the park is on the right a short distance from Kipling. East Reservoir is also reached from Florida Ave, but by taking your first left off of Kipling onto Arkansas Ave. The reservoir is on the left along Arkansas, about a quarter mile from Florida. Main Reservoir can be reached by heading west on Florida Ave from Kipling rather than east, and turning into the parking lot on the right almost immediately. Addenbrook Park is along the east side of Kipling a little less than a mile north of Florida Ave. The entrance to the park is just across from Exposition Ave. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>(Submitted by Nathan Pieplow): This large area includes BLM, Forest Service and state lands. It caters to a wide variety of outdoor recreationists, from four-wheelers to mountain bikers and horseback riders. Depending on when you visit, parts of it may seem overrun, but in reality large chunks of it are always quiet, secluded and inviting to birders. Bohemian Waxwings have occurred here in large numbers in some winters. <br /><br />The western part of this area, just east of Johnson Village near the Collegiate Peaks Overlook, has the best PJ habitat in the county and is a classic spot for Pinyon Jay among other specialties. For the best birding opportunities, drive the good-quality Road 304 past the overlook. A mile or so past the overlook, if you are in a passenger vehicle, you might want to take a left at the trailhead rather than go down the aptly named \"Big Sandy Way.\" However, the entirety of both roads have great habitat, and all of it can be explored on foot. <br /><br />Another section of the FTMA farther east can be terrific birding also. You can drive a loop off US 285 by heading up Shields Gulch on FR 315, taking a right on FR 376E, and heading down McGee Gulch on FR 305. (Naturally, you can also do the same route in reverse.) Shields Gulch starts out in good PJ, then traverses a great Ponderosa savannah which has the likes of Western Bluebird and looks absolutely perfect for Lewis's Woodpecker, although I haven't seen any here yet. McGee Gulch runs though a variety of habitats, from PJ to mid-elevation riparian, some aspen groves, and ponderosa and mixed-conifer stands.

      "<p>The embodiment of Denver&#39;s admirable attempts at the City Beautiful esthetic, City Park today boasts some of the county&#39;s best birding. It is home to both the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. While the majority of it is a typical urban park -- think soccer fields and mature trees surrounded by lawns -- there are aspects that make it appealing to birds. First, check shade trees and evergreens for migrants, which can bunch into large flocks in fall (this is warbler neck at its best). Ferril Lake (the larger one) and Duck Lake (the smaller one alongside the zoo) usually have a fine collection of waterfowl, including occasional rarities such as Long-tailed Duck, Black and Surf Scoters, and Cattle Egret. The island in Duck Lake hosts a breeding colony of Double-crested Cormorants. The island in Ferril Lake hosts breeding Snowy Egrets and Black-crowned Night-herons. Beware the two resident domestic Graylag Geese -- they look suspiciously like the Greater White-fronted Geese that can occasionally be seen in the throngs of white-cheeked geese during migration.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Note that although the park is open from 5 AM to 11 PM daily, the gates that allow cars to enter are closed Sundays from May through September and occasionally during special events.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Pond</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Take Colorado north from US-287 in the middle of Denver, and go 2 blocks to the intersection with 17th Ave. This is the SE corner of the City Park. The park is then bordered on the east by Colorado, on the north by 23rd Ave, the south by 17th Ave, and the west by York St. The park itself can be accessed from parking lots off these roads, or from the myriad of small roads into the park. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

Granby, the largest lake, is usually the least productive for birds. Shadow Mountain and Grand Lake are much better for waterfowl, particularly Barrow's Goldeneye, which is reliable from about mid-October to late April, often in good numbers. Even in the dead of winter there is typically open water in the canal between the two lakes as well as in the part of Shadow Mountain Reservoir adjacent to the canal; the concentrations of waterfowl here can be quite impressive. If they have open water, the two ponds along FR 492 just west of the west entrance to the National Park can be productive for Barrow's Goldeneye, particularly early in the season (October). Feeders around the town of Grand Lake can be productive for hummingbirds in summer and finches at any time of year.

      "<p>This state park lies on the east and south sides of North Sterling Reservoir which is by far the least visited of the four major reservoirs with public access associated with the South Platte River as it flows out of Colorado into Nebraska (Jackson, Prewitt and Jumbo being the other three).  That is, in part, because it is the most remote and has a rocky shoreline without the rich sediment inflow and marshy borders of a Prewitt or Jumbo Reservoir.  But its lack of visits is also due to a probably undeserved reputation as not being very birdy.    Nevertheless, North Sterling Reservoir is usually worth a visit, especially outside of the heat of summer when there can be a lot of boating and camping activity.    Reach the boat ramp by bearing to the right after the main entrance.  It provides the nearest views of an east west peninsula that splits the two major arms of the reservoir.  This peninsula will usually host many resting geese, ducks, gulls, pelicans and cormorantsâ€”but it is a distant view at best.  The boat ramp is also where the reservoir is at its deepest and thus the last spot on the reservoir to freezeâ€”which typically happens by mid-December.  Try early fall for terns and huge concentrations of pelicans; late fall visits to this spot can be good for geese, diving ducks and gulls; and even after frozen there will be tens of thousands of geese traveling back and forth between North Sterling and Jumbo.  Raptors can be encountered anywhere in the parkâ€”over 30 Bald Eagles were here in 2002.    North Sterling has several potentially productive migrant traps.  One is around the park headquarters located across the dam from the boat ramp.  Much better prospects are available in the several wooded groves along the trail that follows the south shore including Barn Owls that seem to use the very first grove along this trail as a late summer roost.  To access this trail, drive through the main campground to a parking area by a footbridge over the inlet canal.  Be prepared to share the wooded groves with masses of insects, but other than bugs and birds expect to have the site to yourself.    The best accessible shorebirding area at NSSP is in the southwest corner.  To get there, take CR 33 south from the entrance to CR 44 and go west for two miles and take CR 29 north to a parking area.  After parking walk to the shoreline where during fall migration a good mix of shorebirds is likely but without the large numbers sometimes encountered at Jackson and Prewitt.  The roads on this drive are good for sparrows, Burrowing Owls in season and usually a few Lapland Longspurs in the masses of Horned Larks in winter.  </p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Reservoir, Grassland/Prairie</p><p><b>Directions:</b> To reach this state park, take I-76 to exit 125 (the Sterling exit) and go west on US-6 into Sterling.

    About:
      "<p>(Submitted by Andrew Spencer): Chatfield is a place of many distinctions. It has the largest bird list of any single location in Colorado, and a larger list than a couple of states. It has the most reliable breeding locations for Least Flycatcher and American Redstart anywhere in Colorado. Not only have multiple state firsts been seen here, but this is the only location that can claim two species of murrelet and one of the few that can claim all three jaegers. The county line situation can be somewhat complicated, especially on the lake. Generally, the county line is far closer to the east side of the lake than one would expect. Everything west of Kingfisher Bridge and the South Platte River is in Jefferson County, while the rest of the park and the reservoir is in Douglas.<p>Thoroughly scanning the lake requires checking it from multiple viewpoints, though scanning from three or four spots on the west side will usually do the job. In the NW corner of the lake is the North Marina, which is the best place from which to scan that corner of the lake. Midway along the west side, the Swim Beach is the classic spot from which to scan that portion of the lake, and provides a decent view of most of the reservoir.<p>Kingfisher Pond, at the southern end of the lake, can produce not only its namesake, but also a multitude of gulls and ducks. By walking north along the eastern edge of the pond you can reach the Platte River Delta, one of the two good shorebird areas in Chatfield.<p>On the east side of the lake, the southernmost spot from which to scan is the New Heron Overlook, which provides a great view of the entire southern third of the lake. The next viewpoint for the lake is the Old Heron Overlook, which provides a good vantage for the middle third of the lake.<p>The Sand Spit, just north of the marina, is arguably the best location in the park. When the water is high on other parts of the reservoir, covering the mudflats, this may be the only location where shorebirds can be found. The trees on the spit are surprisingly productive, and tend to concentrate migrants more than anywhere else in the park. When the water is low there are often large flocks of gulls and even terns on the exposed sandbars. This can also be a good area from which to scan the lake, with almost the entire northern third of the lake in view.<p>The other contender for best location in the park is the nearby Plum Creek Delta. The main reason to come here in most birders' minds is the extensive mudflats that often form here in fall. Large flocks of shorebirds often gather here, and a dozen or more species can sometimes be found, with the occasional rarity. To view them well you may need to walk out onto the flats, acquainting yourself with the famous carnivorous mud of Plum Creek (a couple of Colorado birders were almost lost to this terrible menace). Usually if you don't go too far out onto the flats you will be okay.<p>The riparian habitat that surrounds the delta makes up one of the best migrant traps on the Front Range. The majority of the riparian corridor can be reached from the Plum Creek Nature Area parking lot. There are a multitude of trails here, one of which even crosses Plum Creek and follows the railroad tracks for a long ways.<p>When it comes to riparian habitat in Chatfield, the area along the South Platte River, on both sides, is unbeatable (well, maybe Plum Creek compares). This is area is usually referred to as \"Upstream from Kingfisher Bridge,\" with the east side being in Douglas County, and the west in Jefferson County. Starting with the east side, follow the paved trail through the first patch of large trees (which usually has little else other than starlings) to where a small dirt trail continues south. It is here that the birding gets better, with migrant flocks in the spring or fall producing many a warbler species including the occasional rarity (Kentucky, Worm-eating, and Mourning have been seen, among other species).<p>The west side usually gets more coverage from the admiring birding public. A paved trail goes south for a little ways, and then a multitude of dirt trails continues on. This area is probably the best in the park for the local American Redstarts and Least Flycatchers, with at least one pair of each hanging out along the paved trail, and further down. If you continue south you will eventually come to a large cattail marsh, which has Marsh Wren and rails in season.<p>Probably the most neglected area in the park is below the dam, which has extensive riparian habitat as well as some ponds.<p>While you are at Chatfield, be sure to check out the Waterton Parking Lot area. The area around that parking lot provides little access to areas in Chatfield (though that is where you park to hike up Waterton Canyon), but the nearby Discovery Pavilion parking lot is the trailhead for trails heading downstream along the Platte River. It is here that the trail starting at the Kingfisher Bridge comes out. This area is often underestimated, but as the first state record of Prairie Warbler, or the second state record of Scott's Oriole, or the first park record of Fox Sparrow can attest, it can be quite productive. There is often a nesting American Dipper under the Waterton Bridge, though they also move upstream later in the summer.<p>Finally, just by driving the roads in and around Chatfield, you can often find Ferruginous, Swainson's, and Red-tailed Hawks, Golden Eagle, and Prairie Falcon in the summer, and in the winter all of these minus Swainson's but plus Rough-legged and Harlan's Hawks.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Lowland Riparian, Stream, Grassland/Prairie, Hedgerow/Shelterbelt, Marsh</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From C-470 in southwest Denver, take Wadsworth Boulevard (CO 121) south to the main (Deer Creek) entrance, which is on the left (east) about a mile south of C-470.

      "<p>The Beecher Island Battleground, a National Historic Site, is on private land that permits public access. The site contains a memorial, an informational display, a beautiful picnic area in the middle of mature riverbottom cottonwoods, and a one-mile nature trail through native sandsage prairie, river bluffs, and trees. The Arikaree River bottom mostly lacks underbrush, but some junipers around the buildings provide cover, and the tall trees are likely to host woodpeckers, nuthatches, owls and migrant passerines in season. Keep an eye and an ear out for Northern Bobwhite and possibly Northern Cardinal. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Downstream, another stretch of the Arikaree can be accessed via Simmons State Wildlife Area just east of Beecher Island. The forest here is much less dense, although there are some medium-sized willows worth checking. To the south, the SWA stretches far into the sandsage bluffs.

Just across the river to the northeast is Overland Lake Park, which has a couple of ponds and some lowland riparian habitat. Another half-mile north is Vanderbilt Park, arguably the best of these three, where a thin but dense layer of riparian forest surrounds an isolated pond. Some good warbler might show up here someday. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The southern half of the Denver portion of this greenbelt is accompanied on the west by Platte River Drive, which is by turns sleepy and busy. Its sleepy sections can provide good car access to various stretches of riparian habitat, a fact that will be of particular interest to winter birders looking for ducks along the river. Among others, Barrow&#39;s Goldeneye and interesting hybrids have wintered just north of Alameda. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  North of Colfax, the South Platte Greenbelt can be sketchy and is best birded in pairs or groups, as it passes through industrial Denver and attracts some unsavory characters. Nonetheless, it can be worthwhile. One of the county&#39;s more intriguing locations is just off the South Platte at the northern border of the county: Heron Pond Natural Area. Surrounded by noisy, smelly recycling facilities, Heron Pond often seems overrun by grackles and Mourning Doves, but it can be a good place for other blackbirds, waterfowl, herons and egrets, and Hermit Thrush.

      "<p>This broad valley is one of the jewels of Rocky Mountain National Park. For better or for worse, it is a very long hike to the peaks from here, even from the end of the <a class href=\"http://www.rmnp.com/RMNP-Areas-WildBasin.HTML\" target=\"blank\">Wild Basin</a> Road. But even without hiking, you've got decent shots here at both sapsuckers, all the willow specialties, and (especially in August) Black Swift.<p>Sandbeach Lake trailhead is just past the National Park entrance station. The first mile of the Sandbeach trail goes through the same excellent ponderosa forest you can see around Copeland Lake itself--just more of it. At about 1.2 miles the trail crests the ridge and from there to Sandbeach Lake the habitats are mostly lodgepole, mixed-conifer and spruce-fir. The birding up here can be good, if you're up to the hike.<p>Around Copeland Lake itself, look for all the ponderosa specialty birds, including Williamson's Sapsucker and Band-tailed Pigeon (rare). If you are here between June and early September, look high above the lake for flocks of Violet-green Swallows. You may see a Black Swift in with them, somewhere up in the stratosphere. If they are not over Copeland Lake, keep an eye out for them all the way up to the end of the road, and from there up the trail to Ouzel Falls and beyond.<p>Across the road from Copeland Lake are some interesting willow and aspen habitats which are fairly accessible, but often wet. Outside this immediate area, birding the road between here and its end can be problematic. The road is very windy and narrow in some places two cars may not be able to pass abreast. Park only in designated spots, and be very careful where you bird. At any rate, apart from a nice mountain meadow or two, there usually isn't much reason to stop between Copeland Lake and the Wild Basin trailhead.<p>The area around the Wild Basin trailhead can be fairly birdy, with an avifauna typical of the transition into a higher-elevation (but not spruce-fir) forest. The hike to Ouzel Falls is highly recommended. Especially if you are there early in the summer and early in the day, you have an excellent chance for a wide variety of montane birds on this medium-length hike. Beyond Calypso Cascades the trail passes through an old burn area, now rather too old for Three-toed Woodpeckers, but still attractive to Northern Pygmy-Owls, which nest in the snags, and which you may see if you are insanely lucky. Ouzel Falls itself has in recent years been the breeding site of the Black Swifts which now appear to be more regular in Wild Basin than anywhere else on the East Slope. Staking out the falls, however, is not a particularly good way to see the birds unless done at dawn or dusk, as they visit the nest very rarely during the day. Look for them overhead, or even below you if you are on one of the high points overlooking the valley. The wide variety of scenery and the relative ease of this hike make it a good choice for those traveling with non-birders.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Ponderosa Forest, Aspen Grove, Stream, Streamside Willow, Mountain Meadow, Lodgepole Forest, Burn Area</p><p><b>Directions:</b> The Wild Basin area is in the southeast portion of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Meadow Park, along CO 7 just south of its junction with US 36, has a little riparian habitat and some very impressive sandstone cliffs that are home to White-throated Swift and Canyon Wren; keep an eye out for the local Golden Eagle pair. Bohn Park provides access to the South Saint Vrain Trail, which runs along the river of the same name about half a mile in either direction from the park, through riparian woods worth birding at all seasons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple Valley Road and South Saint Vrain Road are very similar roads—so similar, in fact, that they are sometimes confused. Both are paved rural residential roads that parallel the busy highway on the other side of the river, and both are flanked by riparian cottonwoods on one side and dryer foothill habitats on the other side. The difference between these roads is that they parallel different highways and rivers. Apple Valley Road loops off US 36 and follows the North Saint Vrain, while South Saint Vrain Road (84S on some maps) loops off CO 7 and follows its namesake. Both roads can produce good flocks of migrants in season, including vagrants from the east, and both can produce difficult Boulder County birds like Northern Pygmy-Owl (mostly in winter), Lewis&amp;#39;s Woodpecker (summer), Bushtit and Pinyon Jay.

It sits about 9 miles east of Cherry Creek Reservoir, well away from the urban sights and sounds of Denver. This slight distance makes Aurora Reservoir a reliable site for Snow and Ross's Geese, birds that can be difficult to encounter closer to town. Aurora Reservoir can host a good variety of water birds in the fall and winter, including the usual divers, swans, loons and even scoters. Shoreline is not expansive but can attract migrant shorebirds, with the south shore being best. Gulls and terns are varied and reliable, with many birds sharing time with nearby Quincy and Cherry Creek reservoirs. The park does not hold many trees so passerines are not abundant, but grassland sparrows and raptors add to the good numbers of water birds, making Aurora Reservoir worth a visit. <br /><br />Aurora Reservoir is not part of the State Park System, so your annual Parks Pass will do you no good here.

    About:
      "<p>Walking around the town of Mancos could produce birds at feeders, including hummingbirds, and there is potential for migrant passerines especially along the Mancos River. The Mancos Riverwalk provides some access to this riparian corridor from a parking lot right behind the high school. A better place to bird is probably Cottonwood Park, just west of Spruce Street on the north side of the river. This spot is good for Lewis's and Downy Woodpeckers, Bullock's Oriole, Black-headed Grosbeak, Yellow Warbler, Lesser Goldfinch, etcetera. The Mancos Cemetery south of town may also be worth a look, though it is high and dry--Ladder-backed Woodpecker has been reported from here.<br /><br />Purple Martins and high elevation birds can be found north of Mancos toward the west side of the LaPlata Mountains. On CO 184 just north of Mancos turn east on 42 Rd which becomes FR 561. Mancos Reservoir (a.k.a Jackson Gulch Reservoir), the focus of Mancos State Park, is on this route, but usually doesn't have much in the way of waterbirds, although the park has some good Ponderosa and oak habitats. Continue about 7 miles to a small sign to Box Canyon on the right. Turn right and park at the end of this short deadend. The Box Canyon trail descends into the west branch of the Mancos River, crosses the river a short distance downstream and continues up the east side of the valley. Purple Martins nest in the aspens in the clearings at the top and on toward Green Beal Spring. This is at least an hour's hike one-way. <br /><br />An easier spot to find Purple Martins is farther up FR 561 in the Jersey Jim Flats area where FR 350 turns east. The martins have been seen at the junction of FR 350 and FR 561. <br /><br />An excellent spot for high elevation birds like nutcrackers, Gray Jays, and Three-toed Woodpeckers is farther up FR 350 to the trailhead for the Shark's Tooth Trail. The route number changes, so always follows the signs to the Shark's Tooth Trail. This is only accessible in summer and early fall. <br /><br />Weber Reservoir may be worth a visit when you are in the Mancos area. Although private, it is scannable from FR 566 after it turns east. Mornings would be best.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Urban/Suburban, Lowland Riparian, Stream, Pond/Lake/Reservoir, Ponderosa Forest, Scrub Oak Forest, Aspen Grove, Spruce-Fir Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Mancos is along US 160 about fifteen miles east of Cortez. To get to the Riverwalk, turn south from US 160 onto Beech and follow it to the parking lot behind the high school. To get to Cottonwood Park, turn south from US 160 onto Spruce at the west end of town and follow it to the river. To get to the cemetery, from the intersection of US 160 and CO 184 in the center of town, head straight south on CR 41 through town and about a mile south of it to the cemetery on the left (east). To get to Weber Reservoir, head east from town on US 160 about two miles to a left (north) turn onto CR 44. FOllow this north two-and-a-half miles. When the pavement ends, continue straight on FR 566. The reservoir will be on the left just after the road turns right in half a mile. </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

      "<p>(Contributed by Ted Floyd): This private preserve encompasses more than 100,000 acres of playas, greasewood/rabbitbrush desert, and mixed broadleaf/coniferous woodlands. For permission to visit this site, please contact The Nature Conservancy (TNC) of Colorado. Note that birding trips and workshops  are offered throughout the year; some are free, others have a registration fee, but all require that you sign up in advance.  &lt;p&gt;A good starting point is the headquarters complex, surrounded by mixed woodlands and overgrown fields. A March 2005 TNC workshop produced five species of owls (Western Screech-Owl, Great Horned Owl, Northern Pygmy-Owl, and Long-eared and Northern Saw-whet Owls) right on the grounds of the headquarters complex. A June 2006 workshop produced Gray Flycatcher, Gray Vireo, and Juniper Titmouse (all uncommon at best in the eastern San Luis Valley), plus a rich variety of owls, nightjars, and riparian-associated passerines. Peregrine Falcon and Black Swift (probably sentries from breeding sites in the nearby Sangre de Cristo Mountains) are possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The vast tract of desert north and west of the headquarters is good for breeding Sage Thrasher, Sage Sparrow, and Brewer&#39;s Sparrow. During March, the passage of Mountain Bluebirds through the desert habitats is quite heavy. Plantings around outbuildings and abandoned homesteads attract breeding Say&#39;s Phoebe and Loggerhead Shrike, among others. In winter and during migration, many of the species that occur at Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge can be found in the desert portions of the Medano-Zapata Ranch: diverse waterfowl and raptors, plus Sandhill Cranes (migration only). Several wet meadows and ponds (notably Dollar Lake) are good for aquatic species from early spring through late fall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given its vastness and the full protection that it currently receives, the Medano-Zapata Ranch has considerable potential for the discovery of biologically significant concentrations of uncommon breeders and migrants. Please file trip reports with TNC staff, who will incorporate data on bird sightings into management and conservation plans for the ranch.  &lt;/p&gt;</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Lowland Riparian, Foothill Shrub, Greasewood/Rabbitbrush,, Marsh</p><p><b>Directions:</b> From US 160 fourteen miles east of Alamosa and five miles west of Blanca, turn north on CO 150 and proceed about ten miles north to the ranch entrance on the left (west). </p><p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Hotspot information was originally compiled on <a href='https://coloradocountybirding.org/' target='_blank'>Birding Colorado</a>, a service of Colorado Field Ornithologists.

It boasts several nesting pairs of  Williamson&amp;#39;s Sapsuckers. On a 2007 DFO field trip, nesting pairs were seen and heard between the Picnic Shelter and the mountain peak. Other nesting species include all three Nuthatches, Cordilleran Flycatcher, Violet-green Swallow, Western Bluebird, Vesper Sparrow, Gray-headed Junco, Mountain Chickadee, and Broad-tailed Hummingbird. Warblers are rare, except for Yellow-rumped. Red-Crossbill and Cassin&amp;#39;s Finch are common in the winter.

Western Bluebirds can be seen in the area, as well as Lewis's Woodpeckers. The Ponderosa almost certainly has Grace's Warblers, but to our knowledge, no one has found them yet. Wild Turkey has been seen just over the county line in Mineral, so be on the lookout for this potential first county record. <br /><br />Coming into the county from the south along Piedra Road, you quickly cross the Piedra River. Taking the right turn just past the river will take you to the Piedra Picnic Area in a half mile. The picnic area has a nice mid-elevation riparian tangle that can harbor the likes of Song Sparrow, Spotted Towhee, Yellow Warbler and potentially other lower-elevation species and migrants in season. If you follow FR 635 past the picnic area, it will eventually loop back around to Piedra Road through some magnificent mature ponderosa forest, all of which is on private land and must be birded from the road. The entire loop is good for Lewis's Woodpecker, and the ponderosa sections are also good for things like Western Bluebird. <br /><br /> If you turn right just before crossing the Piedra River, onto FR 714, you will reach some fields in the SE corner of the county that have breeding Savannah Sparrow, and maybe even rails in wet years. <br /><br />If you continue up Piedra Road about three miles from the county line, you can take a left turn onto FR 639. This goes through some of the very best habitat in the county. The Ponderosa, oak and aspen habitat here can produce Virginia's Warbler, Flammulated Owl, Band-tailed Pigeon, Evening Grosbeak and many other fine birds. If you follow the road to the top where it splits three ways and take the right fork (on foot if the road is too rutted for your car), you will get to an area that is good for Williamson's Sapsucker. Somewhere up here there are Grace's Warblers...we just know it! <br /><br />If you continue up the Piedra Road several miles, past the turnoff to Williams Creek Reservoir and across Weminuche Creek, you'll enter a little-traveled area of mixed-conifer forest that transitions into spruce-fir. This is another great area to get high-elevation birds including Gray Jay, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Evening Grosbeak, Red Crossbill and Three-toed Woodpecker. Odds are this is the best road for Dusky Grouse in the county. If you like your woods deep and your roads remote, this is the line for you.</p><p><b>Habitat:</b> Ponderosa Forest, Mixed-Conifer Forest, Streamside Willow, Aspen Grove, Spruce-Fir Forest</p><p><b>Directions:</b> Two miles west of Pagosa Springs on US 160, head north on Archuleta CR 600 (Piedra Road), and stay on this road for 15.5 miles to the Hinsdale County line.
